Top-secret military leaks raise national security concerns 01:51 Link copied April 7, 2023, 10:09 PM UTC / Updated April 9, 2023, 6:17 AM UTC By Dan De Luce U.S. officials think classified U.S. documents about Ukraine's war effort that appeared on-line are likely real and the result of a leak, but that some of the documents may have been altered before they were posted, a senior U.S. official said on Saturday. The official described that as the government's \"working theory\" pending investigation and review. The documents, posted in recent days as photos on Twitter and Telegram, outline Ukraine’s military strength, the state of the conflict, casualty figures and the burn rate for the HIMARS long-range rocket systems that the U.S. provided to Ukraine. Some of them carry a March 1 date. “We are aware of the reports of social media posts, and the Department is reviewing the matter,” Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said on Friday. Ukrainian servicemen on a road near Bakhmut, Donetsk region, on April 6, 2023. Genya Savilov / AFP - Getty Images The Justice Department has started its own probe, said a spokesperson on Friday. “We have been in communication with the Department of Defense related to this matter and have begun an investigation,\" said the spokesperson. \"We decline further comment.\" The documents seem to reveal what the U.S. has learned via signals intelligence — intercepted electronic communications — about Russian plans and operations. A former U.S. intelligence official said there could be serious fallout if a stream of signals intelligence on Russia has been exposed. The New York Times first reported on the documents . It is not known who is behind the alleged leak. After reports of the leak, Ukraine said President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and top military and security officials discussed ways to prevent the leak of military information at a meeting Friday. According to a researcher at Bellingcat, the online investigative group, the documents first appeared on the anonymous image board 4chan in March. Amb. Sullivan: White House ‘needs to take responsibility’ for chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal April 7, 2023 08:15 Different versions of the documents have appeared online since, citing divergent figures for Russian troop casualties in the war. The varying versions and the fact that the numbers are far below casualty estimates by independent military analysts and the Pentagon have fed speculation that the documents have been altered. In one version, the number of Russian troops killed in action was put at 16,000 to 17,500, compared to an alleged 71,500 Ukrainian soldiers killed. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Army Gen. Mark Milley, said in November that as of then roughly 100,000 Russian troops had been killed or wounded in the war, and that Ukraine likely had suffered a similar level of casualties. The documents, including maps and lists of equipment, look to have been folded and then smoothed out. John Sullivan, former U.S. ambassador to Russia and deputy secretary of state, told NBC News’ Andrea Mitchell on Friday that the documents had to be treated with caution. Ukrainian servicemen stand in a trench near their position near the town of Bakhmut on Saturday. Genya Savilov / AFP - Getty Images “There are some indications that ... there are some aspects of the document that have some authenticity to them, but there are also indications that this may be a Russian disinformation campaign, which they’re very good at,” Sullivan said. Russian state media coverage of the documents has been “extremely muted,” said Bret Schafer, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund’s Alliance for Securing Democracy. “Almost all of it has directly cited reporting by others to keep them as distanced as possible.” Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Zelenskyy, said in a post on Telegram that the documents amounted to a “bluff” by Russia and that if Moscow had access to secret information, it would not advertise the information and risk losing crucial intelligence.

But officials in Kyiv and a bereaved mother told NBC News why they felt surrender was not an option. Watch: Wagner Group head Prigozhin waves Russian flag, claims to have taken Bakhmut 00:54 Link copied April 7, 2023, 7:38 AM UTC By Mo Abbas , Matt Bradley and Ostap Hunkevych NIZHYN, Ukraine — Checking social media one day after work, Paraska Demchuk saw a photo of a man she immediately recognized as her son. The image was from a video of his execution that went viral on social media. Smoking his final cigarette in a wooded area, he shouts “Glory to Ukraine” before collapsing in a hail of bullets. “In the end, he understood he couldn’t do anything. He had no weapon, no grenade, no gun. But he had these words,” Demchuk, 67, told NBC News at her modest home in the town of Nizhyn, about 90 miles northeast of Kyiv . Those words helped galvanize a nation even as the graphic video devastated a mother, with her son Oleksander Matsievsky hailed as a hero for uttering the rallying cry in his final moments. The 42-year-old sniper was killed on Dec. 30 near Bakhmut , Ukraine ’s security services said, and his defiant demise has come to symbolize the country’s defense of the eastern city — arguably the most fiercely contested territory in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion . Mercenaries, mud and morale Some experts question Bakhmut ’s strategic importance, and worry that Ukraine — whose nimble, lightning counteroffensives saw it recapture swaths of territory late last year — may be pouring valuable resources into a grinding battle that will undermine fresh offensives planned for the spring. But eight months of brutal trench warfare have transformed Bakhmut from an obscure mining city into a modern-day Stalingrad whose fate could shape the course of the war. Victory for either side would be a huge morale boost, and could rally support from respective allies, providing momentum to shift a front line that has remained largely static for months. For Demchuk, tearful and mourning the loss of her only child, there can be no retreat from Bakhmut. In a corner of her living room Ukraine’s highest medal of honor, awarded posthumously in a red leather-bound case, dominates a shrine to her son. A shrine to Oleksander Matsievsky, who was killed in action near Bakhmut on Dec. 30 according to Ukraine's security services. Mo Abbas / NBC News “We have no other option but to continue fighting. All this blood that was lost cannot be lost in vain. We need to continue defending ourselves,” she said. Bakhmut is almost surrounded by Russian forces, its Ukrainian defenders perilously close to being encircled after months of brutal fighting that has increasingly seen both sides suffer heavy losses. On Sunday Moscow’s forces said they had captured the administrative center of the city, but Ukrainian troops continued to hold western areas. Ukraine said its defenders still held Bakhmut. Neither side publishes casualty numbers among its own troops, but on one day in March alone Kyiv’s military said it killed 221 of Moscow’s forces in Bakhmut, while Russia said it killed 210 Ukrainian soldiers in the broader Donetsk region in which it lies. But according to Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Kyiv has Moscow’s forces just where it wants them. Paraska Demchuk, 67, tears up as she talks about her son, Oleksander Matsievsky, who was killed in action near Bakhmut on Dec 30 according to Ukraine's security services. Mo Abbas / NBC News “It is very important to destroy the most powerful Russian units exactly where it’s comfortable for us. The landscape is preferable for us there,” he said in an interview on Thursday at his office in Kyiv. “Because Russia is concentrating on Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Vuhledar, it cannot attack in other directions — they cannot launch a big offensive somewhere else,” he said, referring to other areas in Donetsk, which forms half of the eastern Donbas region. “Meanwhile, we are preparing our own offensive.” The Kremlin has made capturing Ukraine’s industrial heartland the focus of its campaign but has appeared to make scant progress toward that goal in the first few months of the year. The Russian winter offensive has been held back by muddy conditions and military failings, despite Moscow revamping its leadership, calling up hundreds of thousands of reservists and leaning on the Wagner mercenary group’s use of ex-convicts. But the pressure on Ukraine’s defenders has mounted in recent weeks, and with it so have calls for a withdrawal from some military analysts who view holding the city as no longer worth the cost. For Podolyak, keeping Russia’s much larger army at bay in Bakhmut for eight months is already a victory of sorts, but losing the city would be a ”huge morale boost for the Russians and massive demoralization for Ukraine.” He was echoing a point made by Zelenskyy last week, that if Bakhmut falls to Russia, President Vladimir Putin would “sell this victory to the West, to his society, to China, to Iran” with a push for an end to the war on terms favorable to Moscow. Bakhmut must be defended to stop Putin building support, Zelenskyy says March 29, 2023 00:57 Training for the decisive battles to come Ukraine hopes to launch a spring offensive of its own that could determine its fate as concerns mount that Western support could wane if Kyiv can’t show a clear path to victory and political calculations weigh ahead of the presidential election. Yet Kyiv is fast depleting its stock of experienced soldiers, raising questions over the viability of a battlefield push that is slated to begin in the next few months. “At the beginning of this war, yes, almost all of those who were fighting were experienced servicemen who got their training over several years,” Podolyak said. “But you have to understand that this is a bloody war. Tragically, people are dying, Ukrainians are dying. People on the front lines are exhausted. And therefore we have to rotate them, and you have to understand the active front line is 1,800 kilometers  (1,120 miles) long.” By holding Bakhmut, leaders in Kyiv appear to be betting they can both wear down Russian forces and buy time to ready their own for what could be a decisive period in the war. Russia has been accused of throwing thousands of soldiers with little combat experience against well-defended lines to secure small gains in territory, but Ukrainian officials insist their new recruits will not be cannon fodder. Ukrainian soldiers exit a forest after completing a drill at a forest north of Kyiv on March 31. Mo Abbas / NBC News At a heavily forested military training ground just north of the Ukrainian capital, officers put new soldiers through a compressed training program to prepare them for the spring offensive. “They are doing the very accelerated and contracted version of the standard core training course. They are mastering the basic skills of fighting and survival,” said a training commander, who covered his face with a bandanna and used his call sign “Batman” instead of his name for security reasons. Media were invited to film troops training, and a group of soldiers with at least some combat experience were put through their paces. The unit confidently disembarked from an American mine-resistant ambush protected vehicle, moved in formation into a forest and then stormed a trench as snipers provided cover. Vitaly Markiv, one of the trainers, said these soldiers would be the backbone of units containing less experienced recruits. “Somebody goes on rotation to the front line, then they return and they transmit that experience to the other soldiers and officers,” he said. But, he added, more important than troop numbers was continuing Western support and weaponry. “This year will be the year of revenge, of repayment to the Russians. What we need is the support of the whole free world.” Mo Abbas Mo Abbas is a London-based multimedia producer for NBC News.

Former President Donald Trump at a press conference at CPAC, in Fort Washington, Md., last month. Jabin Botsford / The Washington Post via Getty Images Link copied April 8, 2023, 5:26 PM UTC By Matt Dixon and Jonathan Allen TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — When he wrapped up remarks following his arraignment Tuesday with a familiar promise to “Make America Great Again,” former President Donald Trump pushed into the adoring crowd at his Mar-a-Lago club — ignoring Secret Service instructions to take a pre-cleared path — and made his way to a private patio dinner with his daughter Tiffany, her husband Michael Boulos and longtime conservative operative Sergio Gor. While they ate, surrounded by aides and friends at nearby tables, Trump listened to a playlist he had curated himself. Songs included “Justice for All,” his version of the national anthem with the “J6 choir” of inmates awaiting trial for their roles in the insurrection, Luciano Pavarotti and James Brown singing “It’s a Man’s World,” and selections from Sinead O’Connor and Phantom of the Opera. It was a serene end to one of the most tumultuous days in American political history — one that started with the first booking of a former president on criminal charges in New York and transitioned to the same man, the front-runner for the 2024 Republican nomination, delivering a speech rebuking state and federal prosecutors from his campaign’s base of operations in Palm Beach, Fla. Trump prepares for legal battles amid presidential campaign April 6, 2023 04:27 What Mar-a-Lago provided was a soothing retreat full of Trump’s favorite things: a crowd of friends and family, a quiet dinner on the patio and a 500-song Spotify list that allows him to play disc jockey. If Trump’s mood was mostly reserved that day — from his arrival at the courthouse where he declined to speak to reporters, through a jab-filled but sedately delivered speech, all the way to the end-of-night dinner — it’s a mood his team will be trying to sustain over the coming months as he tries to survive the twin crucibles of an election and criminal jeopardy. The relative calm in the midst of chaos Tuesday belied Trump’s well-earned reputation for failing to control his impulses and for whipping his supporters into frenzies in times of crisis — most notably the one that ended in the Jan. 6 insurrection. But it also revealed the extent to which the smaller, more insular, lower-drama team around him this time has already helped him keep focus and avoided riling him up unnecessarily. That’s not to say it will be easy — or that it will succeed. Trump is still Trump. He continues to push the unfounded claims of a stolen 2020 election, shared a photo of himself holding a baseball bat next to the head of the Manhattan district attorney and has championed the people incarcerated for the Jan. 6 riot on the U.S. Capitol. His team’s discipline promises to be put under severe duress as he simultaneously runs a presidential campaign and defends himself against charges in New York and investigations at the federal level and in Georgia. “I’ve never seen a more professional operation around Trump. I’ve also never seen a Trump-world operation with so little infighting,” said one longtime operative in his orbit. “All of the key people are genuine pros.” Indeed, the biggest difference, according to interviews with half a dozen people working on his campaign or with direct knowledge of its operations, is the type of operatives Trump is surrounded by right now. Gone from the inner circle are figures who sought their own publicity like campaign chiefs Corey Lewandowski, Steve Bannon and Brad Parscale. So are the sycophants who believed the best way to curry favor with Trump was to execute on his most outlandish ideas, like Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell. “We have less people who try to ingratiate themselves with him by going the extreme route,” said one person involved in the campaign who credited Susie Wiles, the co-manager of the operation, with keeping “the crazies” out. “Everything seems to be less dramatic — not drama-free, but less dramatic.” On Friday, the campaign quickly put out a fire lit when the New York Times reported that Trump had instructed aides to hire Laura Loomer , a prominent Trump supporter with a long history of making anti-Muslim comments. Trump allies, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, reacted angrily to the news , and by the end of the day a campaign official confirmed to NBC News that Loomer would not be brought into the fold. No one in proximity to Trump is under the illusion that he will barnstorm across the country for the next year and a half in anything resembling an ordinary campaign; nor would they want him to lose the rawness that connects him to millions of voters. But, for now, Trump insiders are pleased with what they see as a more-disciplined operation that helps the candidate channel his political instincts. That group includes Wiles, co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita, strategist and public-relations veteran Jason Miller, longtime adviser Boris Epshteyn and a set of trusted hands who manage various aspects of security and logistics for his public appearances. They are charged with helping Trump navigate the political side of the ledger while a three-member team of lawyers — Todd Blanche, Susan Necheles and Joe Tacopina — defends him against the charges in New York, along with allegations that he incited the Jan. 6 riot, mishandled classified material and tried to overturn his defeat in Georgia in the 2020 election. Though noticeably more sedate than his fans are accustomed to in his speeches, Trump ripped the judge in the New York case, Juan Merchan, during his speech at Mar-a-Lago Tuesday night. He called the jurist, who appears to have donated $15 to Joe Biden’s campaign in 2020, a “Trump-hating judge with a Trump-hating wife and family.” For any other politician — or defendant — that remark alone would constitute a radical breach of decorum, political savvy and legal strategy. For Trump, an avid golfer, it was par for the course at a time when his legal troubles have solidified his support among the GOP primary electorate. A Trump aide said they do not plan to attempt to significantly rein in the former president when it comes to these attacks, in part because they appear to recognize the benefits in them. While his harsh words for judges and prosecutors are “always a concern for the lawyers,” the aide said the campaign team was less worried. “We see the criticism as mild and factual. It’s not just coming from a place of anger,” the aide said, pointing to Trump highlighting the work Merchan’s daughter’s firm did for Vice President Kamala Harris’ short-lived 2020 presidential campaign. “As far as we are concerned, I would say there are minimal concerns because he behaved appropriately.” Trump has watched his political fortunes rise in recent weeks, but one aide on his 2020 campaign said the political operation’s turnaround was first evident in a February visit to East Palestine , Ohio, the site of a major train derailment that released toxic chemicals into the air. “That felt like that was the first thing they did that was ‘OK, they’ve got their s--- together’” the operative said. Trump railed against President Joe Biden at a rally with Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, in a 10-minute speech and made several stops in town to meet with residents. Last month, he held rallies in Davenport, Iowa, and Waco, Texas, and one adviser said his calendar will soon fill out with big events in early primary states. His next scheduled public appearance is April 14 at the National Rifle Association’s conference in Indianapolis, where several potential rivals for the GOP nomination are expected to speak. Trump insiders say he has been encouraged by Republicans rallying around him in the face of the charges against him. “He is pumped,” the adviser said. “He loves this moment. It’s a moment of vindication in his eyes.” That sentiment may become more acute now that the anxiety of the arraignment is behind him. On his flight to New York Monday, Trump and his aides discussed the logistics of his court appearance for about 25 minutes and then watched Fox News, according to a person who was present. “It was for sure a surreal moment,” the person said. “We were stressed to some degree, of course, but there was no anger, and nothing totally out of the ordinary. “ Trump was virtually silent when he arrived at the courthouse to be finger-printed and sit for the arraignment hearing. “It was a sober moment,” according to an adviser. “He did not really say two words. I think he knew it was not the right moment to do that. He let everyone else do the talking.” The morning after the arraignment and his speech at Mar-a-Lago, Trump posted a note of gratitude to the officials inside and outside the courthouse on his Truth Social media platform. “The great patriots inside and outside of the Courthouse on Tuesday were unbelievably nice, in fact, they couldn’t have been nicer,” Trump wrote. “Court attendants, Police Officers, and others were all very professional, and represented New York City sooo well.” That courtroom setting, and the legal system more broadly, are things Trump and his team will have to become more accustomed to as they try and pull off a historic political high-wire act: returning to the White House facing criminal charges and a handful of separate serious state and federal investigations. His advisers are confident his indictment will provide a short term political boost, and early public polling has backed that assertion it could at least with Republicans. But the person fretted over the long term uncertainty of the historic moment. “We just don’t know,” they said of whether the weight of high profile legal woes and ongoing investigations will eventually bog down his political aspirations. “No one has ever done this before,” the person said. “We just don’t know what’s going to happen here.” Matt Dixon Matt Dixon is a senior national politics reporter for NBC News, based in Florida.

A Trump aide said they do not plan to attempt to significantly rein in the former president when it comes to these attacks, in part because they appear to recognize the benefits in them. While his harsh words for judges and prosecutors are “always a concern for the lawyers,” the aide said the campaign team was less worried. “We see the criticism as mild and factual. It’s not just coming from a place of anger,” the aide said, pointing to Trump highlighting the work Merchan’s daughter’s firm did for Vice President Kamala Harris’ short-lived 2020 presidential campaign. “As far as we are concerned, I would say there are minimal concerns because he behaved appropriately.” Trump has watched his political fortunes rise in recent weeks, but one aide on his 2020 campaign said the political operation’s turnaround was first evident in a February visit to East Palestine , Ohio, the site of a major train derailment that released toxic chemicals into the air. “That felt like that was the first thing they did that was ‘OK, they’ve got their s--- together’” the operative said. Trump railed against President Joe Biden at a rally with Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, in a 10-minute speech and made several stops in town to meet with residents. Last month, he held rallies in Davenport, Iowa, and Waco, Texas, and one adviser said his calendar will soon fill out with big events in early primary states. His next scheduled public appearance is April 14 at the National Rifle Association’s conference in Indianapolis, where several potential rivals for the GOP nomination are expected to speak. Trump insiders say he has been encouraged by Republicans rallying around him in the face of the charges against him. “He is pumped,” the adviser said. “He loves this moment. It’s a moment of vindication in his eyes.” That sentiment may become more acute now that the anxiety of the arraignment is behind him. On his flight to New York Monday, Trump and his aides discussed the logistics of his court appearance for about 25 minutes and then watched Fox News, according to a person who was present. “It was for sure a surreal moment,” the person said. “We were stressed to some degree, of course, but there was no anger, and nothing totally out of the ordinary. “ Trump was virtually silent when he arrived at the courthouse to be finger-printed and sit for the arraignment hearing. “It was a sober moment,” according to an adviser. “He did not really say two words. I think he knew it was not the right moment to do that. He let everyone else do the talking.” The morning after the arraignment and his speech at Mar-a-Lago, Trump posted a note of gratitude to the officials inside and outside the courthouse on his Truth Social media platform. “The great patriots inside and outside of the Courthouse on Tuesday were unbelievably nice, in fact, they couldn’t have been nicer,” Trump wrote. “Court attendants, Police Officers, and others were all very professional, and represented New York City sooo well.” That courtroom setting, and the legal system more broadly, are things Trump and his team will have to become more accustomed to as they try and pull off a historic political high-wire act: returning to the White House facing criminal charges and a handful of separate serious state and federal investigations. His advisers are confident his indictment will provide a short term political boost, and early public polling has backed that assertion it could at least with Republicans. But the person fretted over the long term uncertainty of the historic moment. “We just don’t know,” they said of whether the weight of high profile legal woes and ongoing investigations will eventually bog down his political aspirations. “No one has ever done this before,” the person said. “We just don’t know what’s going to happen here.” Matt Dixon Matt Dixon is a senior national politics reporter for NBC News, based in Florida.

Donald Trump with his defense team during his arraignment in New York,  on Tuesday. Seth Wenig / Pool via Getty Images Link copied April 7, 2023, 9:00 AM UTC By Peter Nicholas WASHINGTON — When news broke earlier this month that Donald Trump would be indicted in New York, leaders of a pro-Joe Biden group met privately to decide what to do. Should they fire off tweets broadcasting what had happened, or maybe send an email blast opining on Trump’s fate? In the end, they did nothing. “Why get your hands dirty if you don’t have to?” a person familiar with the group’s thinking said, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk freely. “When you get into the ring with him [Trump] in this capacity, you’re no better than he is.” No guidebook exists for dealing with the first former president ever to face criminal charges, let alone one who is the current front-runner for the GOP nomination. Lacking any precedent, an ecosystem of Democratic strategists, Biden loyalists and outside groups is gaming out how to wring advantage from Trump’s mushrooming legal woes. They’ve reached no consensus and, for now, are feeling their way through a fraught moment that presents both opportunity and peril for all sides, interviews with more than a dozen political operatives suggest. When opponents are struggling, every campaign’s instinct is to capitalize on their misfortune. Yet Trump is presumed innocent in a legal system that Biden has pledged to uphold, creating a conundrum for the operatives working to defeat Trump in 2024. “Democrats are a party guided by lawyers,” said Simon Rosenberg, a longtime party strategist. With more criminal charges possible in the coming months, Trump’s indictment in Manhattan may prove a dry run for how Biden’s outside supporters respond. Georgia authorities are investigating Trump’s efforts to reverse his election loss in 2020 and wrest the state’s 16 electoral votes from Biden. At the same time, federal prosecutors are looking into Trump’s handling of classified records after he left the White House along with his broader effort to retain power despite his defeat. A group called Facts First USA is plunging in, planning to showcase Trump’s difficulties in digital ads and social media messages while targeting congressional Republicans who’ve chosen to defend him. The group convened a Zoom call to discuss the indictment after it was made public Tuesday and has since had additional conversations about how “it can be leveraged for our purposes,” said David Brock, president of Facts First. “The indictments,” he said, “are going to be the gift that keeps on giving for Democrats.” Another group is trying to nail down an effective message. Anticipating that a Trump indictment in New York was imminent, a coalition of liberal pollsters late last month tested various ways to explain his legal troubles. Navigator Research surveyed more than 1,000 registered voters — Democrats, Republicans and independents alike — to gauge the best way to rebut Trump’s argument that he is the victim of a “witch hunt.” In a memo titled, “Trump Indictment: A Guide for Advocates,” Navigator Research concluded that the most effective counter-argument is that “No one is above the law, not even a former president,” citing their finding that 61% found that idea more convincing than Trump’s claim of political persecution. The message also draws a useful contrast from the Democrats’ perspective. If he decides to run again, Biden is expected to portray himself as a symbol of stability, compared to the tumult that surrounds Trump. Biden’s oft-repeated message that he is trying to restore the nation’s soul and respect the rule of law could seem especially pertinent amid the spectacle of a GOP presidential candidate fighting to stay out of jail. The criminal charges that Trump faces are “just a reminder of the chaos that Trump brings,” said Jenn Ridder, a senior official in Biden’s 2020 campaign who is now seen as a top contender to be his new campaign manager. “Trump is the chaos; President Biden is working to help the American people.” Biden remains silent on Trump indictment ahead of arraignment April 4, 2023 04:02 Still, many in the party are holding back, preferring to keep a tight focus on Biden’s record with the idea that Trump’s difficulties will draw so much attention that no amplification will be needed. “This will block out the sun and supplant all other issues for the time being,” said Zac Petkanas, a longtime Democratic strategist. “So, I don’t anticipate [taking action] in the near term other than helping ensure that the media covers this correctly and helping them debunk misinformation from Trump allies, who are trying to diminish what is in fact a very serious criminal offense.” At his arraignment Tuesday, Trump pleaded not guilty to the 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments made in 2016 to women who alleged past encounters with then-presidential candidate Trump. Trump has consistently denied wrongdoing, as well as the encounters. For Democrats, another complication is the belief among some inside the party that the indictment might not damage Trump all that much. Details of the pay-for-silence allegations have been widely known for the last five years. “There’s a realization on the Democratic side that a lot of Donald Trump’s character flaws are baked into the cake and there’s limited mileage we can get out of them,” said Lis Smith, a Democratic strategist and adviser to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg’s 2020 presidential bid. But the calculus could always change depending on what happens next. Some Biden allies view the case in Georgia as more consequential. If the Fulton County district attorney leading the inquiry files criminal charges, they suggest, that might resonate more with voters as it evokes Trump’s attempts to defy the popular will. “Georgia is a bigger deal,” said a national Democratic strategist, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk more freely. “It’s a reminder to voters that Donald Trump tried to overturn an election and the result of those efforts was Jan. 6,” when pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol. (Trump has said he did nothing wrong and falsely claimed rampant fraud altered the vote in Georgia.) Inside the White House, Biden and his staff are sticking to a simple script: say nothing . Anything Biden says about Trump’s entanglements would invite complaints that he’s meddling in the multiple criminal investigations that the former president faces. The charges announced last week in Manhattan surprised the White House. Biden’s chief of staff, Jeff Zients, alerted him after aides learned of the indictment from news reports, White House aides said. Privately, people close to Biden have been trying to think through what the indictment might ultimately mean for the country, with one suggesting that it could speed up the federal investigation led by special counsel Jack Smith. (It’s not clear why that would be the case; there is no indication that Jack Smith is taking cues from the prosecution underway in New York). One perk of having essentially cleared the field in the 2024 Democratic primary is that Biden can say as much or as little as he wants, knowing that the entire party apparatus is looking after his interests. As he juggles court hearings and campaign rallies, debates and depositions, Trump may not be able to expect the same level of fealty. Though most GOP candidates have voiced support for Trump and said his prosecution is politically motivated, his most serious rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, took a veiled swipe at him by repeating some of the more embarrassing details of the case. “I don’t know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some type of alleged affair,” said DeSantis. That the party’s various factions coalesced behind Biden would have been hard to predict when his presidency began. The party’s liberal wing, in particular, had bristled at Biden’s refusal to embrace a Medicare-for-all health care system. But he has quelled internal dissent. Asked about that dynamic, Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat who co-chaired Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2020 presidential bid, said: “Who in their right mind would want to run against Donald Trump? God bless the president for wanting to run. Would you want your family to go through this against Donald Trump?” Peter Nicholas Peter Nicholas is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.

How will Trump's indictment impact the race for 2024? 03:19 Link copied April 5, 2023, 11:00 AM UTC By Allan Smith Just as Republican voters in the crucial early states get ready to choose their presidential nominee next year, another spectacle may be taking place in the country's biggest city that could affect the outcome of the election: the trial of Donald Trump . On Tuesday, Judge Juan Merchan set a Dec. 4 date for the next hearing in the Manhattan district attorney's case against Trump. The former president pleaded not guilty to the indictment accusing him of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records as part of a scheme to shield the electorate from information about past alleged affairs. Prosecutors pushed for the trial to start in January, while Trump's defense team requested that it begin “later in the spring” next year. If the prosecution gets its way, the country would get a split screen of Trump fighting to prove his innocence in New York while campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire, which hold their nominating contests on Feb. 5 and Feb. 13. On one hand, a trial could greatly limit how much campaigning Trump might be able to do in the closing weeks of those races. On the other, it might offer him a substantial megaphone and media attention that would greatly overshadow the campaigning of his chief rivals. Both Trump allies and critics suggested that they see the latter as the more likely outcome. \"This entire primary is now guaranteed to be completely dominated by Trump earned-media-wise,\" a Republican strategist supportive of Trump said. \"Probably the best-case scenario for him, timing-wise.\" \"It was already extremely tough to effectively attack Trump from the right, and now I think it just became basically impossible,\" this person added. \"How can you effectively land a shot in a way that the base will accept as Democrats are literally trying to put this guy in jail over BS charges?” Trump: ‘I never thought anything like this could happen in America’ April 5, 2023 02:25 A national Democratic operative, who requested anonymity to speak frankly about the colliding storylines, said news that the Manhattan case will at a minimum drag out through the winter was bad news not for Trump, but for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis — who consistently polls as Trump's leading rival for the GOP nomination — and the rest of the Republican field. \"DeSantis' worst nightmare is the fact that he’s going to have to spend the next nine months answering questions about how he feels about Donald Trump’s indictment,\" this person said, adding that the GOP \"hasn’t demonstrated a single inkling that they’re willing to drive a wedge with him.\" \"Because we all know the overwhelming base of the Republican Party right now are MAGA voters, and you can’t alienate them.\" An official with the pro-DeSantis Never Back Down super PAC did not directly address the impact of the primary calendar's clashing with a trial but said, \"Should Gov. DeSantis decide to heed the growing calls from the never-back-down grassroots movement to run for president, he is showing strength in early voting states and would win.\" Still, the fact that Trump's legal team is pushing for a spring start date for the trial could suggest he wants to get through the early states before he is on trial. Merchan described the Trump legal team's spring request as “reasonable,” according to a court transcript, but added, \"The message I would like to deliver is we would like to move ahead as expeditiously as possible, without undue delay.\" Manhattan is not the only jurisdiction where Trump may face legal jeopardy by the time the primary calendar kicks off. Legal experts have said allegations that Trump tried to overturn Georgia’s election results, incited an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and mishandled classified documents — which are the subjects of investigations in Atlanta and Washington, D.C. — are far more serious than the charges he faces in Manhattan. Should Trump be hindered from campaigning as the early state contests near, the Democratic operative noted, he would still be able to get attention in cities like Des Moines and Davenport, Iowa. \"Donald Trump can get on the phone with reporters and get the local Iowa TV station sound bites and still reach Iowa voters if he isn't there physically,\" the Democratic operative said. \"Donald Trump doesn't have to do the glad-handing and kissing the babies in the same way that, like, Ron DeSantis or Tim Scott does.\" It would not be the first time a Trump trial has clashed with the opening presidential contests in Iowa and New Hampshire. In February 2020, Trump's first impeachment trial kept a handful of Democratic senators who were running for president in Washington and off the campaign trail as the vote neared. The trial began in mid-January, and Trump was acquitted on Feb. 5, 2020, two days after the Iowa caucuses. But those senators were not the ones on trial; the high-profile nature of the proceedings instead offered senators a large earned-media opportunity to show off their roles in the trial. Of course, none of their campaigns succeeded against Joe Biden. The prevailing wisdom is Trump, even though he is the one in legal peril, could face a better fate — at least in the primaries. \"I think this makes it even more likely Trump wins [the] primary,\" said former North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican and NBC News contributor. \"It paralyzes other candidates.\" Allan Smith Allan Smith is a political reporter for NBC News. Henry J. Gomez contributed .

The potential payoff is a big reason why the dream of asteroid mining has persisted for decades. Lauren Schatzman / NBC News Link copied April 9, 2023, 12:00 PM UTC By Denise Chow Matt Gialich knows the cosmic odds are against him, but he doesn’t seem to care. Gialich is the co-founder of a startup called AstroForge, which aims  to mine platinum from asteroids, process the materials in space and then sell the refined commodities back on Earth. It’s a venture that has the potential to be wildly lucrative, but it’s also one that for decades has seen its share of attempts and failures — remaining a tantalizing but elusive prospect for innovators and investors alike. AstroForge wants to change that. The company is slated to launch its first test mission Tuesday to demonstrate key technologies that could finally turn asteroid mining into a reality. Later this year, the startup has a second test flight planned to study a space rock up close that could become a prime target for a real mining mission. For a company founded in 2021, it’s a timeline that is so ambitious as to almost seem reckless. But with launch costs now a fraction of what they were a decade ago and a more robust commercial space economy than ever before, AstroForge and other deep-space mining startups are poised to pick up where others have failed. Gialich knows that if the tests are successful, they will transform not only his company, but also the entire space industry. “If we work out, this is very, very lucrative,” he said. “I don’t hesitate to say it’s probably the most valuable company ever created, if we’re successful.” Still, there’s a lot hinging on that success. AstroForge, which last year raised $13 million in seed funding, is hardly the first private enterprise to seriously pursue mining operations in space. A company called Planetary Resources was formed in 2009 to explore the idea of robotically mining a near-Earth asteroid . A few years later, a competitor called Deep Space Industries was founded. Both firms had high-profile investors attached. Both have since been acquired and pivoted into different space tech sectors. The potential payoff is a big reason why the dream of asteroid mining has persisted for decades. Platinum is valued at more than $32,000 per kilogram (almost $15,000 per pound). Asteroids are also thought to contain other precious and rare earth metals that are essential for producing many consumer electronics. On Earth, these raw materials are largely controlled by China, making access to them politically challenging. Other mined minerals are being depleted, setting up scarcity issues for future generations. “There’s no easy-to-grab platinum on the surface anymore. It’s not like you can go discover some new continent,” Gialich said. “The next frontier really is space.” Artemis II crew details their upcoming historic moon mission April 6, 2023 05:33 He added that mining resources in the cosmos will cut down on the environmental degradation and associated greenhouse gas emissions that come with mining on Earth. Extracting precious metals in space is no easy task. For one, metal-rich asteroids are less abundant than carbon-rich asteroids, said Richard Binzel, an astronomer who retired last year after spending 33 years teaching planetary science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Extracting valuable metals is also extraordinarily difficult and technologically challenging,” he said, adding that deep-space mining seems more like a “resource for the space economy of the 22nd century,” rather than something that can be achieved in this century. To overcome some of those technological hurdles, some companies have focused on mining water from icy deposits on the moon or space rocks first before jumping to precious metals. It’s the kind of strategy being pursued by the United Kingdom-based Asteroid Mining Corp. Like AstroForge, the company aims to mine platinum from asteroids, but its founder and CEO Mitch Hunter-Scullion said he envisions a “Swiss Army knife approach” in which  missions are tailored to extract whatever materials are of interest to customers, whether that is water, precious metals or other raw materials. “We want to be incredibly modular from the offset, to provide a wide opportunity of applications that start to exploit these resources,” he added. Hunter-Scullion said he is in talks with a company to conduct a mission in early 2026 to collect samples from the moon. Beyond that, the company is eyeing a mission to an asteroid by around 2031. Binzel said he has consulted potential investors on the topic of space-based resources before, and has highlighted each time the enormous challenges of such operations. “I tell them they have to have a very long time horizon,” he said. “The technological gap is too wide right now that I personally don’t see it being economically viable in this century. But, I always add that it would be great if I’m wrong.” Gialich and AstroForge co-founder Jose Acain are counting on that. Gialich said that what sets their company apart from others that came and went before it has a lot to do with fortuitous timing. Access to space has opened up in recent years as competition has increased among commercial rocket companies, significantly driving down the costs of launching into orbit . “When Planetary Resources was around, if you wanted to go to the moon, it would have cost you $400 million,” he said. “We can do that for two orders of magnitude less. It’s not even in the same ballpark.” For AstroForge’s test flight next week, the company purchased a “rideshare” that allows their small spacecraft to be one of several payloads aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Programs like that simply didn’t exist even a few years ago, and it’s one key way that AstroForge is able to move quickly and keep costs manageable. The company also tries to leverage existing processes and knowledge. NASA and Japan’s space agency have both carried out sample-return missions to asteroids , and their findings have helped AstroForge engineers craft their missions and refine their models. “What we’re doing is just taking what they did and trying to make it cheaper,” Gialich said. “NASA built a Ferrari and we’re trying to build a Honda Civic.” The goal of AstroForge's first mission is to demonstrate that the company can refine materials successfully in low-Earth orbit. This will involve heating a piece of metal until it turns from a solid state into a gas, then bombarding it with microwaves to ionize the gaseous metal, or positively charge the atoms. Magnets will then be used to separate out valuable metals from other materials that might be present on a space rock. If all goes well, Gialich said, he wants to carry out the first real mining mission before the end of this decade. Eventually, AstroForge is hoping to extract 1,000 kilograms (about 22,000 pounds) of platinum or \"platinum-group metals,\" which include rhodium, palladium and iridium, during each mission. Though the company has not revealed the price tag for such an undertaking, Gialich said he wants to keep the cost to around $10 million per launch. If AstroForge does manage to pull asteroid mining out of the realm of science fiction, the company stands to earn a tidy profit. Gialich is not shy about the impact those margins could have, but he said he’s just as driven by the environmental and societal reasons to pursue off-world mining. “We have a fundamental crisis when it comes to metal procurement and commodity procurement, and this is a perfect solution to that problem,” he said. “We’re mining space to benefit Earth. We are trying to solve a problem that faces the planet.” Denise Chow Denise Chow is a reporter for NBC News Science focused on general science and climate change.

The potential payoff is a big reason why the dream of asteroid mining has persisted for decades. Lauren Schatzman / NBC News Link copied April 9, 2023, 12:00 PM UTC By Denise Chow Matt Gialich knows the cosmic odds are against him, but he doesn’t seem to care. Gialich is the co-founder of a startup called AstroForge, which aims  to mine platinum from asteroids, process the materials in space and then sell the refined commodities back on Earth. It’s a venture that has the potential to be wildly lucrative, but it’s also one that for decades has seen its share of attempts and failures — remaining a tantalizing but elusive prospect for innovators and investors alike. AstroForge wants to change that. The company is slated to launch its first test mission Tuesday to demonstrate key technologies that could finally turn asteroid mining into a reality. Later this year, the startup has a second test flight planned to study a space rock up close that could become a prime target for a real mining mission. For a company founded in 2021, it’s a timeline that is so ambitious as to almost seem reckless. But with launch costs now a fraction of what they were a decade ago and a more robust commercial space economy than ever before, AstroForge and other deep-space mining startups are poised to pick up where others have failed. Gialich knows that if the tests are successful, they will transform not only his company, but also the entire space industry. “If we work out, this is very, very lucrative,” he said. “I don’t hesitate to say it’s probably the most valuable company ever created, if we’re successful.” Still, there’s a lot hinging on that success. AstroForge, which last year raised $13 million in seed funding, is hardly the first private enterprise to seriously pursue mining operations in space. A company called Planetary Resources was formed in 2009 to explore the idea of robotically mining a near-Earth asteroid . A few years later, a competitor called Deep Space Industries was founded. Both firms had high-profile investors attached. Both have since been acquired and pivoted into different space tech sectors. The potential payoff is a big reason why the dream of asteroid mining has persisted for decades. Platinum is valued at more than $32,000 per kilogram (almost $15,000 per pound). Asteroids are also thought to contain other precious and rare earth metals that are essential for producing many consumer electronics. On Earth, these raw materials are largely controlled by China, making access to them politically challenging. Other mined minerals are being depleted, setting up scarcity issues for future generations. “There’s no easy-to-grab platinum on the surface anymore. It’s not like you can go discover some new continent,” Gialich said. “The next frontier really is space.” Artemis II crew details their upcoming historic moon mission April 6, 2023 05:33 He added that mining resources in the cosmos will cut down on the environmental degradation and associated greenhouse gas emissions that come with mining on Earth. Extracting precious metals in space is no easy task. For one, metal-rich asteroids are less abundant than carbon-rich asteroids, said Richard Binzel, an astronomer who retired last year after spending 33 years teaching planetary science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Extracting valuable metals is also extraordinarily difficult and technologically challenging,” he said, adding that deep-space mining seems more like a “resource for the space economy of the 22nd century,” rather than something that can be achieved in this century. To overcome some of those technological hurdles, some companies have focused on mining water from icy deposits on the moon or space rocks first before jumping to precious metals. It’s the kind of strategy being pursued by the United Kingdom-based Asteroid Mining Corp. Like AstroForge, the company aims to mine platinum from asteroids, but its founder and CEO Mitch Hunter-Scullion said he envisions a “Swiss Army knife approach” in which  missions are tailored to extract whatever materials are of interest to customers, whether that is water, precious metals or other raw materials. “We want to be incredibly modular from the offset, to provide a wide opportunity of applications that start to exploit these resources,” he added. Hunter-Scullion said he is in talks with a company to conduct a mission in early 2026 to collect samples from the moon. Beyond that, the company is eyeing a mission to an asteroid by around 2031. Binzel said he has consulted potential investors on the topic of space-based resources before, and has highlighted each time the enormous challenges of such operations. “I tell them they have to have a very long time horizon,” he said. “The technological gap is too wide right now that I personally don’t see it being economically viable in this century. But, I always add that it would be great if I’m wrong.” Gialich and AstroForge co-founder Jose Acain are counting on that. Gialich said that what sets their company apart from others that came and went before it has a lot to do with fortuitous timing. Access to space has opened up in recent years as competition has increased among commercial rocket companies, significantly driving down the costs of launching into orbit . “When Planetary Resources was around, if you wanted to go to the moon, it would have cost you $400 million,” he said. “We can do that for two orders of magnitude less. It’s not even in the same ballpark.” For AstroForge’s test flight next week, the company purchased a “rideshare” that allows their small spacecraft to be one of several payloads aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Programs like that simply didn’t exist even a few years ago, and it’s one key way that AstroForge is able to move quickly and keep costs manageable. The company also tries to leverage existing processes and knowledge. NASA and Japan’s space agency have both carried out sample-return missions to asteroids , and their findings have helped AstroForge engineers craft their missions and refine their models. “What we’re doing is just taking what they did and trying to make it cheaper,” Gialich said. “NASA built a Ferrari and we’re trying to build a Honda Civic.” The goal of AstroForge's first mission is to demonstrate that the company can refine materials successfully in low-Earth orbit. This will involve heating a piece of metal until it turns from a solid state into a gas, then bombarding it with microwaves to ionize the gaseous metal, or positively charge the atoms. Magnets will then be used to separate out valuable metals from other materials that might be present on a space rock. If all goes well, Gialich said, he wants to carry out the first real mining mission before the end of this decade. Eventually, AstroForge is hoping to extract 1,000 kilograms (about 22,000 pounds) of platinum or \"platinum-group metals,\" which include rhodium, palladium and iridium, during each mission. Though the company has not revealed the price tag for such an undertaking, Gialich said he wants to keep the cost to around $10 million per launch. If AstroForge does manage to pull asteroid mining out of the realm of science fiction, the company stands to earn a tidy profit. Gialich is not shy about the impact those margins could have, but he said he’s just as driven by the environmental and societal reasons to pursue off-world mining. “We have a fundamental crisis when it comes to metal procurement and commodity procurement, and this is a perfect solution to that problem,” he said. “We’re mining space to benefit Earth. We are trying to solve a problem that faces the planet.” Denise Chow Denise Chow is a reporter for NBC News Science focused on general science and climate change.

NASA announces astronauts in Artemis II mission to orbit the moon 01:36 Link copied April 3, 2023, 4:23 PM UTC By Denise Chow NASA on Monday announced a team of four astronauts who will launch on a critical test flight next year to slingshot around the moon, setting the stage for the agency’s long-awaited return to the lunar surface. In an event held in Houston, the agency named NASA astronauts Christina Hammock Koch, Victor Glover, Reid Wiseman and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen as the crew for its upcoming Artemis II flight, slated to launch in 2024. “The Artemis II crew represents thousands of people working tirelessly to bring us to the stars,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said at the ceremony. “This is their crew. This is our crew This is humanity’s crew.” From left, Christina Koch, Victor Glover, Reid Wiseman and Jeremy Hansen. Josh Valcarcel / NASA The astronauts will be the first humans to fly in the vicinity of the moon in more than 50 years. They will also be the first to launch aboard NASA’s next-generation megarocket and Orion space capsule . The crew will not land on the moon but will swing around the celestial body, testing the performance of the Orion spacecraft, before returning to Earth. If successful, NASA has said that the subsequent Artemis III flight will touch down on the moon with a crew that will include the first woman and the first person of color to step foot on the lunar surface. Wiseman will act as the commander of the Artemis II flight. A former naval aviator test pilot, he was selected to become a NASA astronaut in 2009. In 2014, he launched to the International Space Station on a 165-day mission as part of the Expedition 41 crew. NASA said Glover, a former captain in the U.S. Navy, will be the mission’s pilot. He was selected as an astronaut in 2013 and previously flew on the second crewed flight of SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft to the space station. Koch and Hansen will serve as mission specialists on the Artemis II flight. Koch, who became an astronaut in 2013, set a record in 2020 for the longest single spaceflight by a woman, after spending a total of 328 days in space aboard the space station. During that mission, she also participated in the first all-female spacewalk .​ Hansen was selected by the Canadian Space Agency to become an astronaut in 2009. The former fighter pilot will be the first Canadian to venture to the moon. Artemis II will be the first fully crewed test flight as part of NASA's efforts to return to the moon. Last year, the agency launched its huge Space Launch System rocket and Orion capsule on an uncrewed mission to the moon, where the spacecraft remained in lunar orbit for a few weeks before returning to Earth. The Artemis I flight included mannequins laden with sensors that studied conditions during the mission and measured radiation levels throughout the journey. The Artemis program is named for the goddess of Greek mythology who was the twin sister of Apollo. NASA envisions launching regular missions to establish a base camp on the lunar surface before it eventually ventures to Mars.

Joe Manchin, whose seat is poised to help decide control of the Senate. Alex Mooney and Jim Justice. NBC News / AP file Link copied April 9, 2023, 11:00 AM UTC By Allan Smith and Sahil Kapur Some of the most powerful forces in Republican politics are on course for an explosive — and expensive — collision in West Virginia’s Senate primary . On one side, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Senate Leadership Fund, the McConnell-aligned super PAC, are pushing for Gov. Jim Justice, a former Democrat who switched parties in 2017, to jump into the race. On the other, the big-spending anti-tax group Club for Growth just announced its support for Rep. Alex Mooney,  a member of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus, who has pledged to spend $10 million . The jockeying by Washington power brokers signals the primary could be one of the most expensive in West Virginia history as Republicans target Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin in a key battleground for control of the Senate. The Club for Growth is known to spend freely in GOP nominating contests, while McConnell and allies, stung by a crop of weak candidates in critical races last fall, have been proactive in shaping the 2024 map. “I certainly wish I owned a TV station in the state of West Virginia for the 2024 cycle,” Conrad Lucas, former chair of the West Virginia GOP, told NBC News, alluding to the advertising blitz likely to blanket the state. “It’s very interesting to see this much attention happening this early. Typically, when there’s outside investment, it’s not this early.” In particular, McConnell has made early moves to boost Justice. In February, he highlighted a poll commissioned by the Senate Leadership Fund showing the governor with a commanding lead in a hypothetical primary, telling Fox News that Justice’s advantage was “certainly good news for us” while he was in “a candidate recruitment period.” Manchin won't decide on WH bid 'til the end of the year' April 2, 2023 01:23 Senate Leadership Funds spokeswoman Torunn Sinclair cited the poll Thursday when asked about the race, saying: “Justice would be the runaway favorite in both the primary and general election.” Unlike last cycle, when a bitter feud between McConnell and former  National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Rick Scott led to an incoherent party strategy, the Kentucky Republican’s apparatus and the Senate GOP campaign chief appear to be rowing in the same direction this time. Committee Chair Steve Daines of Montana is “actively recruiting” Justice to run for Senate, a source familiar with the matter told NBC News. A more recent survey conducted by the conservative consultancy group National Public Affairs that was released Tuesday — the same day as the Club for Growth announced its support for Mooney — showed Justice with a 31-point edge over Mooney in a head-to-head race. Even more, the survey of Republican primary voters, conducted in mid-March with a margin of error of plus or minus 5.2 percentage points, found Justice with virtually 100% name recognition and a high favorability rating. Mooney’s popularity was lower, and a third of GOP voters either had no opinion or had never heard of him. Justin Clark, founder of NPA who served in prominent roles on former President Donald Trump's 2016 and 2020 campaigns, said the most surprising element of the survey “was the extreme popularity of Gov. Justice right now.” “I mean, this is a guy who switched parties,” Clark said. “This is a guy who’s gotten into some tussles with the state l egislature at times. Justice is a guy who you wouldn’t necessarily think we’d be as wildly popular as he appears to be.” Additionally, Clark said Mooney – who bested then-Rep. David McKinley in a contested member-versus-member primary last year with former President Donald Trump’s backing – has not seen much “residual” impact in his survey numbers. Clark said his group tested potential attacks on the candidates and “none of those really land on” Justice. “They are going to have to take [Justice] down significantly, like losing his numbers in an incredible way,” Clark said. “That’s very difficult to do. It’s going to take a ton of money to do it. To move his numbers like that, it’s going to be a monumental feat. And I just don’t see it right now.” “They are going to have to take [Justice] down significantly ,” Clark said, adding: “It’s going to take a ton of money to do it. To move his numbers like that, it’s going to be a monumental feat. And I just don’t see it right now.\" And yet, there’s a creeping fear among some pro-Justice Republicans that they could fumble a layup — specifically that the Club For Growth’s endorsement could drive away Justice and risk their best shot at finally defeating Manchin after failing three times in the ruby-red state. Manchin has not yet confirmed whether he will seek reelection, but Republicans who spoke with NBC News expect he will run. A national Republican strategist said the Club For Growth’s financial pledge for Mooney appears designed “to scare Jim Justice” out of running, as the group sought to do with former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, who bowed out of a Senate bid. But the strategist said they don’t expect it to work on Justice, given his strong early advantages in a primary. “It’s a Trump-plus-40 state. If we don’t win that one we’re not winning anywhere else,” the strategist said. “Without West Virginia, there is no Republican majority next cycle.” Meanwhile, Club for Growth PAC President David McIntosh called Mooney a “conservative champion,” vowing that the deep-pocketed organization will “do whatever it takes to make sure he’s elected.” In February, McIntosh said Justice is “in what we would call the moderate camp” and made clear his conservative group “wouldn’t support him in the primary.” Asked to comment on the GOP primary, NRSC spokesman Mike Berg said, “We’re confident West Virginia voters will nominate a candidate who can win both a primary and a general election.” The Club for Growth does have recent experience lifting a lesser-known candidate over a well-known ex-governor. In last year’s midterm election, the Club for Growth helped boost then-Rep. Ted Budd, R-N.C., the eventual general election winner, over former North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory, even though McCrory enjoyed a substantial polling advantage early in the cycle. But Lucas said the dynamics at play in West Virginia, a much smaller state than North Carolina, make it difficult to compare the two. And, unlike McCrory, Justice still occupies the governor’s mansion. “We’re very relationship-based,” Lucas said. “In West Virginia, your retail [politics] still matters. And Justice is so well-liked that changing opinions of West Virginians is difficult whenever they feel that they have such a personal relationship with their own governor.” Justice has previously expressed that he is “seriously considering” a run, and one West Virginia Republican predicted that with state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey announcing a gubernatorial bid, Justice could declare his Senate candidacy within eight weeks. (Morrisey, who was also seen as a potential Senate candidate, jumped into the governor's race with a Club for Growth endorsement.) But this person added that Justice should prepare for a substantial primary fight versus Mooney no matter what the polling says now. “Justice loves a fight, man,” this person said. “He likes campaigns. He likes the challenge. He just does. But Justice has never really been substantially challenged in the primary.” This person noted that a significant portion of the state has yet to familiarize itself with Mooney, who relocated from Maryland in 2013 and has represented districts in Congress encompassing the eastern and northern portions of West Virginia. “Mooney’s never even run in the southern part of the state, so they don’t know him at all. There’s room to grow there,” this person said, adding current polling comes “before a single red cent has been spent, which I think is going to start kicking off here very soon.” The Trump factor remains an open question. The former president has previously endorsed Justice, who announced his party switch alongside him in 2017, and multiple Republicans who spoke with NBC News noted the two have a strong relationship. But Trump also backed Mooney last year in a primary contest the former president was keyed into. Plus, Trump has repeatedly denigrated both McConnell and the Club for Growth in recent months. “Look, Trump endorsed Mooney in his last race versus McKinley. Trump is buddies with Justice,” this person said. “But how can he go against a Freedom Caucus guy when the Freedom Caucus is one of his biggest defenders out there and he’s trying to run a national campaign?” Spokespeople for Justice and Mooney did not respond to requests for comment. Republicans are as focused on West Virginia as they are in part because of its importance in regaining the Senate majority. Manchin’s seat, along with Ohio and Montana seats currently held by Democrats that are up in 2024, are seen as the three most promising targets for the GOP to recapture. Manchin, for his part, recognizes the hurdles he faces. He has said he’s in no rush to make a decision and might even wait until December to finalize his plans. He has mused about facing Justice in a general election, saying he’s friends with the governor and his family and that he’d want a clean, issues-focused campaign without negative attacks if they square off. More recently, Manchin has raised eyebrows by keeping the door open to a presidential run on an independent ticket, in tandem with the centrist group No Labels. It would be a quixotic move, all but guaranteed to fail, with the rise of negative partisanship further entrenching the two-party system. Manchin insists he’s frustrated with the extremes of both parties, a message he may ultimately use to run for re-election to the Senate. Even with national forces descending on the Mountain State for its Republican primary, Clark said he ultimately believes “this is going to be a very local race.” “And I think anyone on the ground who starts to turn this into a D.C. proxy war,” he said, “is going to regret that.” Allan Smith Allan Smith is a political reporter for NBC News.

Joe Manchin, whose seat is poised to help decide control of the Senate. Alex Mooney and Jim Justice. NBC News / AP file Link copied April 9, 2023, 11:00 AM UTC By Allan Smith and Sahil Kapur Some of the most powerful forces in Republican politics are on course for an explosive — and expensive — collision in West Virginia’s Senate primary . On one side, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Senate Leadership Fund, the McConnell-aligned super PAC, are pushing for Gov. Jim Justice, a former Democrat who switched parties in 2017, to jump into the race. On the other, the big-spending anti-tax group Club for Growth just announced its support for Rep. Alex Mooney,  a member of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus, who has pledged to spend $10 million . The jockeying by Washington power brokers signals the primary could be one of the most expensive in West Virginia history as Republicans target Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin in a key battleground for control of the Senate. The Club for Growth is known to spend freely in GOP nominating contests, while McConnell and allies, stung by a crop of weak candidates in critical races last fall, have been proactive in shaping the 2024 map. “I certainly wish I owned a TV station in the state of West Virginia for the 2024 cycle,” Conrad Lucas, former chair of the West Virginia GOP, told NBC News, alluding to the advertising blitz likely to blanket the state. “It’s very interesting to see this much attention happening this early. Typically, when there’s outside investment, it’s not this early.” In particular, McConnell has made early moves to boost Justice. In February, he highlighted a poll commissioned by the Senate Leadership Fund showing the governor with a commanding lead in a hypothetical primary, telling Fox News that Justice’s advantage was “certainly good news for us” while he was in “a candidate recruitment period.” Manchin won't decide on WH bid 'til the end of the year' April 2, 2023 01:23 Senate Leadership Funds spokeswoman Torunn Sinclair cited the poll Thursday when asked about the race, saying: “Justice would be the runaway favorite in both the primary and general election.” Unlike last cycle, when a bitter feud between McConnell and former  National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Rick Scott led to an incoherent party strategy, the Kentucky Republican’s apparatus and the Senate GOP campaign chief appear to be rowing in the same direction this time. Committee Chair Steve Daines of Montana is “actively recruiting” Justice to run for Senate, a source familiar with the matter told NBC News. A more recent survey conducted by the conservative consultancy group National Public Affairs that was released Tuesday — the same day as the Club for Growth announced its support for Mooney — showed Justice with a 31-point edge over Mooney in a head-to-head race. Even more, the survey of Republican primary voters, conducted in mid-March with a margin of error of plus or minus 5.2 percentage points, found Justice with virtually 100% name recognition and a high favorability rating. Mooney’s popularity was lower, and a third of GOP voters either had no opinion or had never heard of him. Justin Clark, founder of NPA who served in prominent roles on former President Donald Trump's 2016 and 2020 campaigns, said the most surprising element of the survey “was the extreme popularity of Gov. Justice right now.” “I mean, this is a guy who switched parties,” Clark said. “This is a guy who’s gotten into some tussles with the state l egislature at times. Justice is a guy who you wouldn’t necessarily think we’d be as wildly popular as he appears to be.” Additionally, Clark said Mooney – who bested then-Rep. David McKinley in a contested member-versus-member primary last year with former President Donald Trump’s backing – has not seen much “residual” impact in his survey numbers. Clark said his group tested potential attacks on the candidates and “none of those really land on” Justice. “They are going to have to take [Justice] down significantly, like losing his numbers in an incredible way,” Clark said. “That’s very difficult to do. It’s going to take a ton of money to do it. To move his numbers like that, it’s going to be a monumental feat. And I just don’t see it right now.” “They are going to have to take [Justice] down significantly ,” Clark said, adding: “It’s going to take a ton of money to do it. To move his numbers like that, it’s going to be a monumental feat. And I just don’t see it right now.\" And yet, there’s a creeping fear among some pro-Justice Republicans that they could fumble a layup — specifically that the Club For Growth’s endorsement could drive away Justice and risk their best shot at finally defeating Manchin after failing three times in the ruby-red state. Manchin has not yet confirmed whether he will seek reelection, but Republicans who spoke with NBC News expect he will run. A national Republican strategist said the Club For Growth’s financial pledge for Mooney appears designed “to scare Jim Justice” out of running, as the group sought to do with former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, who bowed out of a Senate bid. But the strategist said they don’t expect it to work on Justice, given his strong early advantages in a primary. “It’s a Trump-plus-40 state. If we don’t win that one we’re not winning anywhere else,” the strategist said. “Without West Virginia, there is no Republican majority next cycle.” Meanwhile, Club for Growth PAC President David McIntosh called Mooney a “conservative champion,” vowing that the deep-pocketed organization will “do whatever it takes to make sure he’s elected.” In February, McIntosh said Justice is “in what we would call the moderate camp” and made clear his conservative group “wouldn’t support him in the primary.” Asked to comment on the GOP primary, NRSC spokesman Mike Berg said, “We’re confident West Virginia voters will nominate a candidate who can win both a primary and a general election.” The Club for Growth does have recent experience lifting a lesser-known candidate over a well-known ex-governor. In last year’s midterm election, the Club for Growth helped boost then-Rep. Ted Budd, R-N.C., the eventual general election winner, over former North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory, even though McCrory enjoyed a substantial polling advantage early in the cycle. But Lucas said the dynamics at play in West Virginia, a much smaller state than North Carolina, make it difficult to compare the two. And, unlike McCrory, Justice still occupies the governor’s mansion. “We’re very relationship-based,” Lucas said. “In West Virginia, your retail [politics] still matters. And Justice is so well-liked that changing opinions of West Virginians is difficult whenever they feel that they have such a personal relationship with their own governor.” Justice has previously expressed that he is “seriously considering” a run, and one West Virginia Republican predicted that with state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey announcing a gubernatorial bid, Justice could declare his Senate candidacy within eight weeks. (Morrisey, who was also seen as a potential Senate candidate, jumped into the governor's race with a Club for Growth endorsement.) But this person added that Justice should prepare for a substantial primary fight versus Mooney no matter what the polling says now. “Justice loves a fight, man,” this person said. “He likes campaigns. He likes the challenge. He just does. But Justice has never really been substantially challenged in the primary.” This person noted that a significant portion of the state has yet to familiarize itself with Mooney, who relocated from Maryland in 2013 and has represented districts in Congress encompassing the eastern and northern portions of West Virginia. “Mooney’s never even run in the southern part of the state, so they don’t know him at all. There’s room to grow there,” this person said, adding current polling comes “before a single red cent has been spent, which I think is going to start kicking off here very soon.” The Trump factor remains an open question. The former president has previously endorsed Justice, who announced his party switch alongside him in 2017, and multiple Republicans who spoke with NBC News noted the two have a strong relationship. But Trump also backed Mooney last year in a primary contest the former president was keyed into. Plus, Trump has repeatedly denigrated both McConnell and the Club for Growth in recent months. “Look, Trump endorsed Mooney in his last race versus McKinley. Trump is buddies with Justice,” this person said. “But how can he go against a Freedom Caucus guy when the Freedom Caucus is one of his biggest defenders out there and he’s trying to run a national campaign?” Spokespeople for Justice and Mooney did not respond to requests for comment. Republicans are as focused on West Virginia as they are in part because of its importance in regaining the Senate majority. Manchin’s seat, along with Ohio and Montana seats currently held by Democrats that are up in 2024, are seen as the three most promising targets for the GOP to recapture.

Judge suspends FDA approval of key abortion pill and gives government time to appeal 06:57 Link copied April 8, 2023, 6:19 PM UTC By Mirna Alsharif Congressional Democrats quickly condemned the Friday decision by U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk , who was appointed under former President Donald Trump, to suspend the Food and Drug Administration’s longtime approval of key abortion pill mifepristone , while top Republicans in Congress have yet to weigh in. Kacsmaryk has given the government a week to appeal his decision, and President Joe Biden said his administration will file an appeal. If the ruling does eventually go into effect, it would curtail access to the standard regimen for medication abortion nationwide. The top Democrat in the House, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-NY., said the \"Extreme MAGA Republican assault on abortion care is spreading across America like a malignant tumor.\" \"A rogue Judge just suspended FDA approval of mifepristone,\" Jeffries tweeted . “We must all speak up, show up and stand up until the far-right uprising is peacefully and democratically crushed.\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called the ruling \"another massive step towards Republicans’ goal of a nationwide abortion ban,\" adding that it \"could throw our country into chaos.\" \"This ruling from an activist judge is wildly out of step with the law and sets a dangerous new precedent,\" Schumer wrote in a statement shared to Twitter. \"Senate Democrats are relentlessly working to protect a women's right to choose from this extreme MAGA Republican agenda.\" Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., also took aim at Judge Kacsmaryk and the GOP. “Republicans will never rest in their cruel, tyrannical quest to disrespect a woman’s right to choose,” she tweeted . Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., and Senate GOP Whip John Thune of South Dakota have remained silent on the ruling. The FDA approved mifepristone more than 20 years ago to be used in combination with a second drug, misoprostol, to terminate pregnancies at up to 10 weeks. Over half of U.S. abortions are done by medication abortion , according to the Guttmacher Institute , a research group that supports abortion rights. The pills have become increasingly significant in the fight over abortion access since Roe v. Wade was overturned last June. While there is little legal precedent for a court to overturn an FDA approval of a drug, some abortion rights advocates were not surprised by this decision from Kacsmaryk, who earlier in his career represented a Christian conservative legal group, First Liberty Institute. The group had sued the federal government challenging the part of the Affordable Care Act that required employers to provide free insurance coverage for birth control. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., also slammed Kacsmaryk. \"One Trump-appointed judge in Texas thinks he knows better than decades of scientific evidence and ruled to block access to medication abortion nationwide,\" she tweeted . \"Because of today’s lawless ruling, women could lose access to a safe and legal medication they’ve relied on for decades.\" Abortion rights adovcates protest in front of the J Marvin Jones Federal Building and Courthouse in Amarillo, Texas, on Mar. 15. Moises Avila / AFP via Getty Images file Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., echoed Warren's sentiments in a statement: “This ruling by a hard-right Trump appointed judge is simply bulls***.\" Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., shared to on Twitter images of what pregnancies look like at 6, 7, 8 and 9 weeks. \"Are those pictures of human beings? I don’t know. But I do know this: that decision should be made by the woman, not by GOP politicians or religious fanatic judges,\" he wrote. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., called the decision \"another blow to the right to reproductive freedom from a Republican-appointed judge.\" Biden has warned that the Texas ruling poses a risk to abortion rights nationwide, not just women in Texas. \"If it stands, it would prevent women in every state from accessing the medication, regardless of whether abortion is legal in a state,” the president said in a statement . “It is the next big step toward the national ban on abortion that Republican elected officials have vowed to make law in America.” Mirna Alsharif Breaking news reporter About Contact Help Careers Ad Choices Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Personal Information CA Notice Terms of Service NBC News Sitemap Advertise Select Shopping Select Personal Finance © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL NBC News Logo MSNBC Logo Today Logo\n",

Judge suspends FDA approval of key abortion pill and gives government time to appeal 06:57 Link copied April 8, 2023, 6:19 PM UTC By Mirna Alsharif Congressional Democrats quickly condemned the Friday decision by U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk , who was appointed under former President Donald Trump, to suspend the Food and Drug Administration’s longtime approval of key abortion pill mifepristone , while top Republicans in Congress have yet to weigh in. Kacsmaryk has given the government a week to appeal his decision, and President Joe Biden said his administration will file an appeal. If the ruling does eventually go into effect, it would curtail access to the standard regimen for medication abortion nationwide. The top Democrat in the House, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-NY., said the \"Extreme MAGA Republican assault on abortion care is spreading across America like a malignant tumor.\" \"A rogue Judge just suspended FDA approval of mifepristone,\" Jeffries tweeted . “We must all speak up, show up and stand up until the far-right uprising is peacefully and democratically crushed.\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called the ruling \"another massive step towards Republicans’ goal of a nationwide abortion ban,\" adding that it \"could throw our country into chaos.\" \"This ruling from an activist judge is wildly out of step with the law and sets a dangerous new precedent,\" Schumer wrote in a statement shared to Twitter. \"Senate Democrats are relentlessly working to protect a women's right to choose from this extreme MAGA Republican agenda.\" Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., also took aim at Judge Kacsmaryk and the GOP. “Republicans will never rest in their cruel, tyrannical quest to disrespect a woman’s right to choose,” she tweeted . Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., and Senate GOP Whip John Thune of South Dakota have remained silent on the ruling. The FDA approved mifepristone more than 20 years ago to be used in combination with a second drug, misoprostol, to terminate pregnancies at up to 10 weeks. Over half of U.S. abortions are done by medication abortion , according to the Guttmacher Institute , a research group that supports abortion rights. The pills have become increasingly significant in the fight over abortion access since Roe v. Wade was overturned last June. While there is little legal precedent for a court to overturn an FDA approval of a drug, some abortion rights advocates were not surprised by this decision from Kacsmaryk, who earlier in his career represented a Christian conservative legal group, First Liberty Institute. The group had sued the federal government challenging the part of the Affordable Care Act that required employers to provide free insurance coverage for birth control. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., also slammed Kacsmaryk. \"One Trump-appointed judge in Texas thinks he knows better than decades of scientific evidence and ruled to block access to medication abortion nationwide,\" she tweeted . \"Because of today’s lawless ruling, women could lose access to a safe and legal medication they’ve relied on for decades.\" Abortion rights adovcates protest in front of the J Marvin Jones Federal Building and Courthouse in Amarillo, Texas, on Mar. 15. Moises Avila / AFP via Getty Images file Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., echoed Warren's sentiments in a statement: “This ruling by a hard-right Trump appointed judge is simply bulls***.\" Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., shared to on Twitter images of what pregnancies look like at 6, 7, 8 and 9 weeks. \"Are those pictures of human beings? I don’t know. But I do know this: that decision should be made by the woman, not by GOP politicians or religious fanatic judges,\" he wrote. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., called the decision \"another blow to the right to reproductive freedom from a Republican-appointed judge.\" Biden has warned that the Texas ruling poses a risk to abortion rights nationwide, not just women in Texas. \"If it stands, it would prevent women in every state from accessing the medication, regardless of whether abortion is legal in a state,” the president said in a statement . “It is the next big step toward the national ban on abortion that Republican elected officials have vowed to make law in America.” Mirna Alsharif Breaking news reporter About Contact Help Careers Ad Choices Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Personal Information CA Notice Terms of Service NBC News Sitemap Advertise Select Shopping Select Personal Finance © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL NBC News Logo MSNBC Logo Today Logo\n",

Nashville council set to vote to reinstate Justin Jones to state House 03:03 Link copied April 7, 2023, 6:38 PM UTC By Rose Horowitch and Megan Lebowitz A majority of members of the Nashville Metropolitan Council will vote to reinstate Justin Jones to the Tennessee state Legislature after he was expelled from the House of Representatives on Thursday over his protests on the chamber floor against gun violence. Twenty-three members of the 40-seat Metropolitan Council confirmed to NBC News or on social media that they plan to vote to reinstate Jones to the Legislature. 'Assault on democracy': Expelled Tenn. State Rep. Jones speaks out April 7, 2023 05:19 The council, which currently has 39 members, will hold a special meeting Monday to discuss an interim replacement for Jones' seat. Vice Mayor Jim Shulman said he expects the council will take action to suspend the rules at the meeting to vote on a successor to fill Jones' seat instead of holding a monthlong nomination period. In interviews with NBC News, members expressed outrage at Jones' expulsion and said hundreds of constituents have reached out to demand that he be reinstated. “They removed the voice from 140,000 people who voted for them,\" said Councilmember Burkley Allen. \"It’s a terrible precedent to set, that we disagree with you and you’ve disrupted our House proceedings and therefore we’re expelling you. That’s not the way democracy works.” Jones and two other Democratic state lawmakers led a protest on the House floor last week to call for stricter gun safety measures after a mass shooting at a private elementary school in Nashville. Jones and Pearson used a bullhorn to lead chants and spoke without being recognized. Tennessee House leaders called the protest an “insurrection.” But Nashville Councilmember Brett Withers pushed back on the characterization, saying claims that the protest was an insurrection were “unfounded.” Jones was expelled from the Tennessee House of Representatives in a 72-25 party-line vote on Thursday, and the other ousted member, Justin Pearson, was booted in a vote of 69-26 later in the day. Rep. Gloria Johnson was also up for expulsion but clung to her seat. Johnson, who is white, said the disparity “might have to do with the color of my skin,” The Tennessean reported . Both Jones and Pearson are Black. Democratic state Rep. Justin Jones of Nashville gestures during a vote on his expulsion from the state legislature in Nashville, Tenn., on Thursday. Seth Herald / Getty Images Under the Tennessee State Constitution, an interim successor can be appointed by the legislative body of the expelled member's county until a special election is held. For Jones, that is Nashville. The Nashville council, which is the legislative body of the city and Davidson County’s consolidated government, is officially a nonpartisan body, but Councilmember Russ Bradford said most members are Democrats. Pearson is from Memphis, and Shelby County Commission Chairman Mickell Lowery did not immediately respond to NBC's request for comment on the process for Pearson's potential replacement or reinstatement. In an interview with MSNBC, Jones said Thursday \"was a very grave day for democracy and a very dangerous precedent was set not just for Tennessee, but for the nation.” \"This is attacking democracy on so many different levels, and then to refuse to seat us after expelling us, I mean, this — this is saying that Tennessee is on the border or is already faced with authoritarianism,\" Jones said. In the wake of Jones' expulsion, Councilmember Bob Mendes said he heard an \"outcry\" from constituents who want to see the representative reinstated. Several hundred residents had reached out to him as of Friday morning, he said. Councilmember Erin Evans, who represents a purple part of the county, said even her more conservative constituents have said Jones' expulsion was an \"egregious overstep by the statehouse.” Other representatives pushed back on the punishment not matching the incursion. \"No elected official in the State of Tennessee has ever been expelled for breaking decorum rules,\" Councilmember Jeff Syracuse said in an email to NBC News. \"Expulsion was an egregious act of disenfranchising the voters who duly elected State Rep Jones.\" Councilmember Ginny Welsch told NBC in an email, \"I think the actions taken by the Tennessee legislature are blatantly fascist, and racist, need to be called out as such.\" Members of the council also criticized the gun laws that the representatives were protesting following the mass shooting, in which six people were killed , including three 9-year-olds. \"'We don't know anything about you, whether you're qualified to have a gun or not, just have at it,'\" Councilmember Joy Styles said, criticizing lax gun laws. \"Welcome to the state of Tennessee.\" Vice President Kamala Harris, who tweeted that the state GOP lawmakers' move was \"undemocratic and dangerous,\" will travel to Nashville on Friday to meet with Democratic legislators , her press secretary said.

Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg and Rep. Jim Jordan. Bloomberg via Getty Images ; AP Link copied April 7, 2023, 9:00 PM UTC By Megan Lebowitz House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, on Friday requested testimony from Matthew Colangelo, senior counsel to the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, ramping up his investigation into DA Alvin Bragg's prosecution of former President Donald Trump. \"Given your history of working for law-enforcement entities that are pursuing President Trump and the public reporting surrounding your decision to work for the New York County District Attorney’s Office, we request your cooperation with our oversight in your personal capacity,\" Jordan, a Trump ally, wrote in a letter to Colangelo. He asked Colangelo to hand over a slew of documents and communications related to his employment in the DA's office, as well as investigations into Trump and his business, to the committee. He also asked Colangelo to schedule a \"transcribed interview\" with committee staff by April 21. In the letter, Jordan insisted that the Manhattan DA's “unprecedented prosecutorial conduct” needs oversight to inform potential future legislative changes. He also implied that the aim of the committee's investigation is to prevent \"politically motivated prosecutions of current and former Presidents.\" The Manhattan DA's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. House Judiciary Chair subpoenas former Bragg prosecutor April 6, 2023 01:34 After Bragg’s investigation into Trump led a grand jury in New York City to indict the former president last week, his allies quickly rallied to his defense , blasting Bragg’s case against him. Colangelo, who previously worked as a senior official in the Justice Department, was hired by the Manhattan DA's office last December to focus, in part, on sensitive and high-profile white collar investigations. Jordan has ramped up his investigation into Bragg in recent weeks. On Thursday, he subpoenaed Mark Pomerantz, a former New York prosecutor who had led an investigation into Trump's finances and publicly criticized Bragg for not charging the former president sooner. Bragg has repeatedly hit back at congressional Republicans' efforts to investigate his criminal case against Trump. In a statement responding to the subpoena, Bragg accused them of trying to \"undermine\" the case through \"an unprecedented campaign of harassment and intimidation.\" \"Repeated efforts to weaken state and local law enforcement actions are an abuse of power and will not deter us from our duty to uphold the law,\" Bragg wrote in the statement that was shared to Twitter . Trump was arrested and surrendered to authorities at the Manhattan courthouse earlier this week. He pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to his alleged role in hush money payments made during the end of the 2016 presidential election cycle.

Tensions are flaring between House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, left, and  Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Tom Williams / CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images file Link copied April 7, 2023, 8:02 PM UTC By Sahil Kapur WASHINGTON — House Speaker Kevin McCarthy had to fight tooth and nail to secure the gavel. Now, tensions between him and some of his top deputies are spilling out into the open. The chilly relationships further complicate challenges facing the Republican majority ahead of key deadlines to avert a government shutdown and a global economic meltdown in the coming months. McCarthy faces the daunting task of unifying his wafer-thin majority behind legislation that will also need Democratic support. Under normal circumstances, the House majority leader and the Republican Budget Committee chairman would be natural allies as McCarthy seeks to thread that needle. But, as The New York Times reported this week, those relationships are fraying and McCarthy has privately criticized Budget Chair Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La. According to the Times, the comments came after Arrington quietly put out feelers during McCarthy's battle for the speaker's gavel to see if GOP lawmakers may instead back Scalise for the job. NBC News has not independently confirmed Arrington's moves during the speaker battle or McCarthy's private remarks, but three House Republican aides confirmed that there are tensions in McCarthy's relationships with key GOP leaders. Talks between Biden and McCarthy stall as debt ceiling deadline looms March 29, 2023 02:07 The chilly dynamic was on display two weeks ago when the speaker dismissed Arrington’s plan to craft a debt limit offer , telling reporters: “I don’t know what he’s talking about.” Some believe McCarthy is deflecting blame. \"He’s made zero progress in debt negotiations and is getting nervous because he knows all these secret side deals and promises he made during his speaker race are not going to pan out,\" a senior House Republican aide told NBC News, requesting anonymity to speak candidly about sensitive internal dynamics. \"So he’s trying to lay the groundwork to point fingers.\" The Republican aide was also puzzled by McCarthy tapping Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., to lead Republican debt limit negotiations, calling it an attempt “to distance himself” from the issue. “What other speaker in history has outsourced debt ceiling negotiations to a random rank and file?” the aide said. A second senior House GOP aide said they were “surprised” to see the tensions spilling out into the open. “But it’s no secret Scalise and McCarthy’s teams have always kinda been at odds,” the aide said. Arrington’s office didn’t comment. McCarthy’s office referred to his remarks to the Times rejecting fissures with top deputies, calling Scalise “an essential partner” and praising Arrington’s work on the budget. Scalise’s office defended the majority leader’s work but didn’t weigh in on the relationship with McCarthy. Arrington, as budget chief, is a pivotal figure in crafting two must-pass bills: the debt ceiling extension and a government funding bill. Republicans are struggling to agree on a set of demands ahead of a deadline that’s set to hit between June and September. Many in the GOP doubt they will pass a budget resolution, a nonbinding collection of priorities and policy vision. Divisions in the party have already caused House Republicans to struggle to pass messaging bills to beef up border security and rebuke liberal prosecutors. Scalise, meanwhile, is McCarthy's No. 2. His communications director, Lauren Fine, issued a lengthy statement defending Scalise’s work on setting “the most productive floor schedule Congress has seen in years,” sending five bills to President Joe Biden’s desk, working with “every committee chair” to craft the House Republican agenda and having “led the effort to bring to the floor and pass” H.R.1, the new majority’s signature energy bill. Arrington's Democratic counterpart defends him In the White House and on Capitol Hill, Democrats see the emerging angst within the House Republican caucus as validation of their strategy to refuse to attach conditions to a debt limit increase, which would not authorize new spending but rather enable the U.S. to borrow to pay off existing debt imposed by Congress. Rep. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee, said the failure lies with McCarthy. “Republicans took raising the debt limit hostage and yet have no idea what ransom they want for it. Kevin McCarthy promised the sun, moon and stars to his Republican colleagues in order to get elected speaker. Now that he can’t even produce a GOP budget, he’s shifting the blame onto other Republican colleagues,” Boyle said. “Sadly, the GOP dysfunction raises the odds of default.” In an unusual move, the Democrat also defended the Republican chairman amid the reported criticism from the GOP speaker. “Chairman Arrington is both well liked and respected by members on my side of the aisle,” Boyle said. “He’s a bright, principled conservative.” McCarthy has his share of defenders in the House GOP. Rep. Kelly Armstrong, R-N.D., backed McCarthy’s approach on the debt limit, saying the \"real problem\" is Biden’s refusal to negotiate. Armstrong criticized anonymous staff and lawmakers for \"airing perceived slights and grievances,\" saying it sounds like \"junior high.\" \"And these types of comments don’t help our leverage and is exactly why McCarthy has been smart to not try and negotiate terms in public,\" he said. A third senior Republican aide acknowledged the tension between GOP leaders and committee chairs. “Their messaging is often in tandem but not coordinated,” the aide said, leaving rank-and-file members often unclear as to what the priorities are and who is directing conference traffic. The aide said the problems aren’t “raising serious alarm bells” — yet — because Republicans have been able to achieve goals like passing the energy bill and investigating the Biden administration. But with bigger challenges on the horizon, the aide added, “At some point we will all have to start rowing in the same direction.” Sahil Kapur Sahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.

Clarence Thomas speaks out after report reveals lavish vacations paid for by top GOP donor 02:00 Link copied April 7, 2023, 3:24 PM UTC / Updated April 7, 2023, 6:40 PM UTC By Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON — Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas on Friday explained his failure to disclose trips paid for by a friend , conservative billionaire Harlan Crow. Thomas said in a statement that Crow and his wife, Kathy, are \"dearest friends\" and that he and his wife have joined them on family trips for years. \"Early in my tenure at the Court, I sought guidance from my colleagues and others in the judiciary, and was advised that this sort of personal hospitality from close personal friends, who did not have business before the Court, was not reportable,\" Thomas said. \"I have endeavored to follow that counsel throughout my tenure, and have always sought to comply with the disclosure guidelines,\" he added. Thomas, one of the court's six conservative justices, noted that he would comply with changes made to disclosure rules that were announced last month. Those revisions made it clear that trips on private jets and stays at privately owned resorts like one Crow owns in upstate New York would have to be disclosed. The change to disclosure rules tightened an exemption for \"personal hospitality\" that was not strictly defined. That tweak was made just weeks before a ProPublica article published Thursday detailed extravagant trips that Thomas took that were funded by Crow. Thomas did not disclose these trips — reportedly including travel on Crow’s private jet and visits to the resort — on his annual financial disclosure statements. Under the rules that existed until recently it was not clear if he was required to , but — whether he was or not — ethics experts have questioned his judgment. The “personal hospitality” exemption means judges and justices don’t have to disclose certain gifts, including accommodations and food, when the person involved is a friend. The new interpretation made it clear that travel by private jet and stays at resort-type facilities owned by private entities have to be disclosed. Stephen Gillers, an expert on judicial ethics at New York University School of Law, said on Friday that Thomas' explanation was inadequate. \"Thomas has made no effort to defend his conduct except to say he was misled by those he consulted,\" he said. Thomas' statement was effectively \"a confession that he violated the rules albeit because he was misled,\" Gillers added. Before Thomas' statement was released, Gillers had said that the disclosure rules, prior to the recent update, were \"sufficiently vague\" that Thomas could have plausibly made the argument that he was not required to make the disclosure. Thomas has been the focus of much scrutiny in recent months, largely driven by the actions of his wife, Virginia \"Ginni\" Thomas, including her support for former President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Thomas himself faced criticism for failing to step aside from cases involving Trump and the election. The Supreme Court's 6-3 conservative majority has angered liberals by dramatically shifting American law to the right, most notably with its ruling last year that overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that said women had a constitutional right to obtain abortions. The latest developments have renewed calls for Supreme Court justices to adopt an ethics code of conduct similar to the one that binds lower court judges. Among other things, that code requires judges to “avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all activities.” If judges breach the code, they can be investigated and reprimanded through a separate complaint process. The justices say they follow the spirit of the code, introduced in 1973, but they have never formally adopted one of their own. There is also no procedure that allows for complaints to be investigated short of the drastic step of impeachment. Members of Congress have introduced legislation requiring the justices to adopt a code. Lawrence Hurley Lawrence Hurley covers the Supreme Court for NBC News Digital.

Thousands of Los Angeles Unified School District teachers and Service Employees International Union 99 members rally outside the LAUSD headquarters in Los Angeles on March 21. Damian Dovarganes / AP Link copied April 9, 2023, 1:15 AM UTC / Source : Associated Press By The Associated Press LOS ANGELES — Los Angeles Unified School District workers have approved a labor dea l following a three-day strike over wages and staffing that halted education for students in one of the nation’s largest school systems. The agreement, which was voted on this week, would increase wages by 30% for workers who are paid an average of $25,000 a year, the Local 99 chapter of the Service Employees International Union said Saturday. It also includes a $1,000 bonus for employees who worked during the Covid-19 pandemic and expanded family health care benefits. The contract still needs to be approved by the school district’s Board of Education. The school district said the board could take it up for a vote at a meeting on April 18. Thousands of workers backed by teachers went on strike last month and rallied outside the school district’s headquarters in downtown Los Angeles amid stalled contract talks. The goal was to demand better pay and increased staffing for the bus drivers, cafeteria workers, teachers’ aides and other employees represented by the union. LAUSD and school workers union reach agreement March 25, 2023 00:30 Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass thanked the school district and union for coming to an agreement in late March following the strike. “We must continue working together to address our city’s high cost of living, to grow opportunity and to support more funding for LA’s public schools, which are the most powerful determinant of our city’s future,” the Democrat said in a statement. The SEIU said many district support staffers live in poverty because of low pay or limited work hours while struggling with inflation and the high cost of housing in Los Angeles County. The school district serves more than half a million students in the area, an enrollment size that is second only to the New York City Public Schools system. Max Arias, the union’s executive director, touted the deal as “a major step” to improve pay, hours and benefits for workers who “have been left behind for far too long.” “This contract recognizes the essential work of those who work hard to ensure students can learn in a clean, safe, and supportive environment,” Arias said in a statement. At the time of the strike, Superintendent Alberto M. Carvalho had accused the union of refusing to negotiate.

EzriCare Artificial Tears have been linked to an outbreak of drug-resistant bacteria never seen before in the U.S. EzriCare Link copied April 9, 2023, 10:00 AM UTC By Erika Edwards The deadly bacteria linked to recalled eyedrops causing infection and blindness had never been seen in the U.S. until 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It has since infected dozens and killed three people. Even though the contaminated bottles have been removed from stores and health care facilities, the CDC expects more cases to be identified. What has infectious disease experts most alarmed is how this bug — a well-known type of bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa — has evolved in a way that is resistant to nearly all available treatments. As of April 7, the CDC had identified 68 cases of a new strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 16 states. The investigation is still underway, although the agency has to wait for states to report other cases. More than half of the cases have been found in long-term health care facilities. Nearly all are linked to contaminated eyedrops that had been imported from India. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been around for years. In 2020, there were an estimated 28,800 drug-resistant cases in hospitals in the United States, a CDC investigator not authorized to speak to the media said. But the new infections revealed a form that had never before been reported in the U.S.: carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa with Verona integron-mediated metallo-β-lactamase and Guiana extended-spectrum-β-lactamase. The long name basically shows how its genes have transformed to make it more drug resistant over time. \"This was a Pseudomonas original,\" Dr. Robert Bonomo, a professor of medicine at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland who has studied a variety of drug-resistant bacteria since 1990, said in an interview. Tainted eyedrops linked to three deaths and extensive vision loss March 22, 2023 02:02 The CDC's investigation revealed that the infections linked to the eyedrops may only be treated by one known antibiotic, called cefiderocol. There's nothing new about the way the mutated bacteria harms the body. It's the drug resistance that makes it so dangerous. Eye infections have been most common. But because the eyes are directly linked to the nasal cavity, the bacteria can move into the respiratory tract and lead to pneumonia. \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa can affect pretty much any tissue in the body as travels through the blood, and it can cause sepsis,\" said Dr. Guillermo Amescua, a cornea specialist at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Amescua's team has treated seven patients affected by the outbreak. The Connecticut Department of Public Health investigated its first case in June 2022. Since then, a department spokesman said, the agency has identified 26 patients. Most have been in long-term health care facilities. Otherwise healthy people can spread the bacteria without ever knowing they carry the bacteria on their skin, although there is no evidence of person-to-person spread outside of health care facilities, the CDC expert said. Most cases have been linked directly to the contaminated eyedrops. What eyedrops have been recalled? EzriCare artificial tears was the brand most commonly reported among those who later became ill. Those drops have since been recalled , along with Delsam Pharma's Artificial Tears and its Artificial Eye Ointment . Three patients have died. Eight needed corneal transplants. Four have had at least one eye removed. The CDC first alerted the public to the potential danger surrounding the eyedrops in a statement on Jan. 20. But physicians across the country had been reporting cases of the new bacterial infections since at least last summer. On Monday, the Food and Drug Administration released a preliminary report from an inspection at the Global Pharma Healthcare facility in India, finding problems with the manufacturing process and the factory's measures to assure sterility, according to reporting from The Associated Press. Most of the infections were not caught until they were advanced. Juan Lopez and his wife, Mercedes Lopez. This occurred in the case of Juan Lopez, 93, of Miami, Florida. He'd been using the now recalled EzriCare artificial tears for months before developing an eye infection in January. His doctor prescribed antibiotic eyedrops. But by the beginning of February, Lopez developed a 103 degree fever and was hospitalized. Blood tests revealed drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Lopez was successfully treated, and advises others to pay attention to unusual symptoms. \"Don't delay. Definitely go get checked,\" he said. The mutated strain of Pseudomonas underscores the growing risk of antibiotic resistance . \"These bacteria were on the planet way before we were, and over millions and millions of years, they've evolved mechanisms by which they can survive,\" said Bonomo, the Cleveland professor. \"We like to think we can keep up, but they have the propensity to be one step ahead,\" Bonomo said. \"This puts us in a bad place.\" Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook .

The mutated strain of Pseudomonas underscores the growing risk of antibiotic resistance . \"These bacteria were on the planet way before we were, and over millions and millions of years, they've evolved mechanisms by which they can survive,\" said Bonomo, the Cleveland professor. \"We like to think we can keep up, but they have the propensity to be one step ahead,\" Bonomo said. \"This puts us in a bad place.\" Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook .

Ferencz. Brooks Kraft / Getty Images file Link copied April 8, 2023, 6:16 PM UTC By Minyvonne Burke and Rich Schapiro Ben Ferencz, a former prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials who secured convictions against 22 Nazi death squad commanders, has died. He was 103. His son confirmed his death to NBC News. Ferencz was the last living prosecutor from trials marking the first time in history that mass murderers were prosecuted for war crimes. Ferencz was 27 at the time and later played a crucial role in securing compensation for Holocaust survivors and creating the International Criminal Court at The Hague. A tireless advocate for human rights, he also wrote nine books and dozens of articles, gave countless speeches and traveled the world into his 90s spreading his motto of \"law not war.\" \"I was damn lucky to live this long,\" Ferencz told NBC News in November in what was his last media interview. \"I hope that I’ve done some good during that lifetime.\" Ferencz turned 103 on March 11. A photo posted to his official Twitter page showed him in a wheelchair holding a small piece of paper that read, \"Do something you love.\" One of Ferencz's friends re-posted the tweet on Saturday, telling people to be \"filled with gratitude that we had him, in all his wisdom, for so long.\" \"My friend and mentor of more than 25 years, the inspirational Ben Ferencz, passed away last night,\" Dan Skinner tweeted , adding, \"RIP, Ben.\" Ferencz, born in 1920 to Hungarian Jews, was 10 months old when his family immigrated to the United States and settled in New York City. He grew up poor on the rough and tumble streets of Hell’s Kitchen, where his father worked as a janitor-turned-house painter. He attended the City College of New York and earned a scholarship to Harvard Law School. He enlisted in the Army after graduation as World War II engulfed Europe, landing in Normandy and fighting in the Battle of the Bulge. He was later transferred to a unit responsible for gathering evidence of war crimes as the allied forces closed in on the center of the Nazi power in Berlin. Ferencz traveled to multiple concentration camps — Buchenwald, Mauthause, Flossenburg, Ebensee — often within days and sometimes hours of their liberation. Ferencz said it was \"grim as hell\" and he \"had to refrain from letting it get to me emotionally\" so it did not interfere with his job of securing Nazi records before they were destroyed. \"My goal was clear: Grab the documents,\" he said. \"I headed straight to the main office and closed it off. 'Nobody goes in or out without my permission. No German, no American — nobody. I want complete control of the archives,' which I got.\" Ferencz and his team collected thousands of documents at the camps and facilities in Berlin, including detailed reports on the Einsatzgruppen, special SS units that roamed Nazi-occupied Europe and killed more than 1 million people. Those documents were later used to seal the fates of the Nazi death squad commanders during the trial. Fourteen of the 22 who were convicted were sentenced to death. But only four were executed. After the trial, Ferencz was recruited to lead an effort to return property seized by the Nazis to its owners or their heirs and was called in to help negotiate a reparations agreement with the government of West Germany. It was a fraught and dangerous undertaking but the German government ultimately agreed to compensate Holocaust victims around the world. Since the agreement was finalized, roughly $90 billion has been distributed to Holocaust survivors, according to the Claims Conference. Ferencz was also involved in pushing the Germans to agree to maintain cemeteries where Holocaust victims were buried. After spending 10 years in Germany, he relocated his family to the U.S. Ferencz is survived by his four children. His wife, Gertrude, died in 2019, his website states. Minyvonne Burke Minyvonne Burke is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News.

Sequoia Middle School in Fontana, Calif. Google Maps Link copied April 8, 2023, 4:19 PM UTC By Minyvonne Burke Video footage posted on social media shows a California teacher repeatedly saying the n-word in class as she tries to get a student to repeat the racial slur after her. The video was posted on Facebook and was filmed at Sequoia Middle School in Fontana. In it, an unidentified female teacher says the slur and tells the student, \"You asked me how to spell it so go ahead and pronounce it.\" The teacher says the word again. \"Pronounce it after me,\" she tells the student, repeating the slur two more times. It's not clear when the video was filmed. Miki R. Inbody, superintendent of schools for the Fontana Unified School District, called the incident an \"unfortunate exchange\" between the teacher and student. She said it happened \"in connection to its use in a historical literary work.\" Students said they were reading a Mark Twain novel when a classmate asked the teacher about the spelling of the n-word, according to KABC of Los Angeles. \"Fontana Unified School District is proud to serve a diverse community and is deeply committed to providing safe, inclusive learning environments where all students can achieve their full potential,\" Inbody said in a message posted on the district website. \"As a District, we take such incidents very seriously and we are committed to ensuring that our learning environment is inclusive and welcoming for all students,\" she continued. \"We understand that such incidents can be hurtful and upsetting, especially for students who come from diverse backgrounds. We want to assure you that we do not tolerate any form of discrimination or prejudice in our school, and we are taking steps to address this issue and prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.\" The district did not identify the teacher and has not said whether she has been disciplined. Officials with the district and school could not immediately be reached for comment on Saturday. Inbody said that training and support will continue to be provided for teachers, administrators and staff \"to ensure that they understand the importance of creating an inclusive and respectful learning environment.\" \"We will also work with our students to provide opportunities for open and honest dialogue about the impact of language and behavior on others,\" the message read.

Abbott calls for pardon of Army sergeant convicted in protester's death in Texas A jury found Daniel Perry guilty in the shooting. Gov. Greg Abbott on Saturday announced his desire to see Perry granted a state pardon. U.S. Army sergeant found guilty in fatal shooting of protester in Texas 01:29 Link copied April 8, 2023, 5:12 AM UTC / Updated April 8, 2023, 10:33 PM UTC By Dennis Romero A U.S. Army sergeant who fatally shot a protester in 2020 at an Austin demonstration against police brutality and racial injustice was convicted Friday of murder. A Travis County jury found Daniel Perry, 35, guilty in the death of Garrett Foster, 28. Police said Perry, based at the time 70 miles north at Fort Hood, was driving in downtown Austin on the evening of July 25, 2020, when he encountered demonstrators in the street and came to a stop. Foster was legally carrying a semiautomatic rifle when he approached the intersection where protesters had gathered, police said, and was fatally shot by Perry, who stayed in the vehicle and used a handgun. Perry claimed to police that Foster, a U.S. Air Force veteran, had pointed the weapon at him, inspiring him to shoot in self-defense, officials said after the violence. Foster was pronounced dead at a hospital. The day of Perry's arrest more than a year later, after a county grand jury returned a murder indictment against him, Perry was freed on $300,000 surety bond, Travis County District Attorney José Garza Garza said at the time. Perry’s stint in the Army will end as a result of the conviction, his attorney, Clint Brode, said by text. Austin police investigate a homicide shooting which occurred at a demonstration against police violence in downtown Austin, on July 25, 2020. Stephen Spillman / USA Today Network file “Daniel was most crushed that his conviction will end his Army service,” the lawyer said. “He loved being a soldier for our country.” He had remained on active duty during his prosecution, and he had been reassigned to duty at Fort Wainwright, Alaska, according to the publication Stars and Stripes. Although sentencing for Perry, who faces up to life in prison, was expected to be held in the coming days, Gov. Greg Abbott on Saturday may have upended the process by announcing his desire to see Perry granted a state pardon. \"I am working as swiftly as Texas law allows regarding the pardon of Sgt. Perry,\" the governor said in a tweet. Abbott suggested the sergeant should have been exempted from prosecution and Friday's verdict under the state's \"stand your ground\" law, which allows Texans to open fire when people or property are threatened with serious violence, kidnapping, or robbery. The law considers home and vehicle primary spaces for such a defense. Abbott said he'd requested the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles approve a pardon , which is required before the governor may grant one. Among considerations for the board is \"evidence of actual innocence,\" according to state law, and whether two of three trial officials endorse a pardon. Those include the judge, district attorney, sheriff, and police chief in the county where conviction took place. Asked if he had a response to the governor's announcement, attorney Brode said the defense was \"completely focused\" on preparing for sentencing. Perry, who was led away in handcuffs after the verdict was read on Friday, planned to appeal, the lawyer said. “We are disappointed in the verdict both as it relates to Daniel Perry and as it relates to a citizen’s ability to defend themselves,” Brode said by text Friday. “We are hopeful that the case will ultimately be overturned.” Foster had been at the demonstration in Austin with his fiancée, Whitney Mitchell, his mother, Sheila Foster, told \"Good Morning America\" a few days after his death. The couple, dating since they were 17, were fixtures at protests against police abuse that spring and summer, she said. The May 25, 2020, killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis officer who knelt on his neck for 9½ minutes sparked protests across the nation. Members of the jury and relatives of both the victim and the defendant all reacted emotionally to the decision Friday. \"There's no winners in this,\" Garrett Foster's father, Steve Foster, said outside the courtroom Friday. \"Just glad it's over.\" Dennis Romero Dennis Romero is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital.

The happened around 4:25 p.m. in Woodland, California, a city 20 miles northwest of Sacramento, police said. An officer noticed a vehicle, later determined to be stolen, being driven \"erratically,\" tried to stop it, and ended up in a short vehicle pursuit, the Woodland Police Department said in a statement. The pursuit came to a deadly conclusion at an intersection, the department said. \"The car collided with two other vehicles causing two cars to catch fire,\" it said. A woman died, and three juveniles, including the 13-year-old, were among approximately 10 people hospitalized, Woodland police Sgt. Victoria Danzl told NBC affiliate KCRA of Sacramento. The 13-year-old was the only person in the vehicle at the time of the crash, Danzl said. It wasn't clear what preceded the chase. The conditions of the 10 injured weren't immediately available.

NBC News decided to try out chatbots in \"The Eternal City.\" Is AI technology the future of travel? 02:29 Link copied April 4, 2023, 10:44 AM UTC By Claudio Lavanga ROME — “When in Rome, do as the Romans do,” the proverb says. But what if you’re only in the Italian capital for just one day and you’re keen to fit in as much of its history and culture as possible? Sure, you could take a few hours out to plan your trip or you could try to book a tour guide to take you round “The Eternal City.” But now there’s a third option: Tourism apps, websites and chatbots that use artificial intelligence to tailor itineraries for the user based on their preferences and time. They’re rapidly popping up, so NBC News decided to put three of them to the test. We decided to try ChatGPT , a quirky chatbot developed by artificial intelligence company OpenAI that was not specifically designed for travel planning. Along with similar programs, its fluency comes for the most part from having been trained on giant troves of text mined from the internet, but it does not have the ability to filter what is accurate or not and has hit the headlines in recent months because of some of its controversial and upsetting responses. We also used iplan.ai, an app you can download to your phone, and usevacay.com, a chatbot and itinerary planner that uses OpenAI's GPT technology to help you tailor your trip. Our choices were based on recommendations from technology websites. Let’s just say the results were mixed at best. Our day started at La Bottega del Caffé, a bar and restaurant in Piazza Madonna dei Monti, a pedestrian square in a bohemian neighborhood near the Colosseum and Forum. Basking in the glorious sunshine of the brisk spring morning, we opened our phones and downloaded iplan.ai, a “smart travel planner” app that claims to produce “a tailor-made travel plan for any kind of trip,” in just a few seconds. With a simple and user-friendly interface, the app allowed us to pick the city, the number of days we were spending there, our interests, our budget and the time of day we wanted to use it. Without using long sentences, it also linked out to Google Maps so you could read reviews. In the time it takes to drink an espresso, a detailed itinerary appeared for the day and into the night, including a list of some of Rome’s most popular landmarks like the Colosseum and Trevi Fountain . Restaurants for lunch and dinner as well as a bar for an evening aperitivo were also among the suggestions. So far, so good. But closer inspection of the timings revealed a flaw. The Pantheon in the historic center of Rome is one of Italy's top tourist sites. Ciancaphoto Studio / Getty Images Sure, you could visit St. Peter’s Square at 3 a.m., but make sure you wear running shoes. You could be chased by Swiss Guards, as at that time the square is well and truly closed. As for the Capitoline Museums, they are definitely not open at 5:30 a.m. Four hours later, you’ll be fine. You could also spend 120 minutes throwing coins into the Trevi Fountain, but your budget would have to be big and one or two over the course of a few minutes would probably suffice. Three hours in the Piazza Navona would probably give enough time to eat at most of the many restaurants there and run a few laps around the square to digest the food. Needless to say, we ignored the timings, but we decided to stick with the itinerary. We headed to the Colosseum nearby, and unsurprisingly, we weren’t the only ones with that idea. The lines were enormous and tickets were sold out when we looked online. At this we opened up ChatGPT and asked it to find us somewhere to go nearby. It suggested the Forum — the ruins of government buildings where elections, trials and processions were held in ancient Rome. Again the lines were enormous, but to be fair to ChatGPT, it is not intended as a real-time reaction tool because its learning data cuts off in 2021 and it cannot provide information about times or the weather. However, it would be helpful if apps and chatbots could tell us about this and provide information about timings and tickets at two of Rome’s biggest attractions. In the end, a little local knowledge saved the day. A walk up a road next to the Forum takes you to a spot where you can see the ancient ruins from a distance. Not ideal, but better than nothing. After the walk, it was definitely time for a little lunch, so we opened usevacay.com and looked for an alternative itinerary for the rest of the day. It also has a chatbot, which helps you narrow down questions so it can provide a more tailored response. The new itinerary recommended “Da Enzo al 29,” a restaurant with a good reputation for genuine Roman dishes and a favorite with the locals in Trastevere, one of the city’s most picturesque neighborhoods. But again we hit a similar problem: long lines. The family-run restaurant doesn’t take bookings, so people were stretched out for at least a block in hopes of getting a table. But luckily a little local knowledge came to our aid once again as Roberto, one of the managers, recognized me as a former customer and without any prompting guided us to a table. Usevacay.com recommended a cacio and pepe, and it was delicious. We followed up with some tiramisu. Tourists also flock to the Colosseum. Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images Feeling like we could use a walk, we went back to usevacay.com. It recommended that we head for the narrow streets of Trastevere, which it said is “lined with colorful buildings and quaint shops.” The streets were narrow, the buildings colorful, but the shops were not so quaint, apart from one selling gelato, overlooking the beautiful Piazza Santa Maria. Carbs and cobblestones are, however, a deadly mix. Time to stop for some culture, so we turned to ChatGPT. “Where can I see some art nearby?” I typed, and we were directed to the Galleria Corsini, an art gallery with paintings from several Italian Renaissance masters, including Caravaggio and Raphael. For once, no line. And after a day thwarted, that’s something to celebrate. Back to usevacay.com to ask about a wine bar, and where better than at Il Goccetto. There we toast the future of travel planning, despite one or two reservations. In fairness, developers are still honing the technology, and they do make it clear that you should treat them as a guide rather than take them as gospel. Asked about some of the pitfalls we encountered, Drew Shepard, CEO of usevacay.com, said in an email that the company recognized “there is always room for improvement.” He added that the company was “actively working on enhancing our user interface to provide a more engaging and accurate experience, incorporating features like embedded links, maps, and better-tailored suggestions.” Salman Taghiakbari, CEO of iplan.ai, said something similar. “While ‘shopping-tourism’ is a challenging area for us, we have plans to make improvements in this area, as well as in ‘gastronomy-tourism’ in version 2 of the app. This next phase will also allow users to book attractions directly through the app,” he said in an email. On Friday, after NBC News’ visit, OpenAI took ChatGPT offline temporarily in Italy after the independent national data agency raised concerns over possible privacy violations and for failing to verify that users were aged 13 or above, as it had requested. A spokesperson for ChatGPT initially pointed us in the direction of its plugins blog . In response to the regulator’s move, the spokesperson said the company is “committed to protecting people’s privacy and we believe we comply with” privacy laws. “Our users in Italy have told us they find ChatGPT helpful for everyday tasks and we look forward to making it available again soon,” they said. Usevacay.com is still working, however. A spokesperson said “we don’t currently collect any of the user input fields nor the resulting outputs.” Of course, it’s all subjective. For me, AI did provide a good starting point, but the technology is not quite there yet. When in Rome ... Claudio Lavanga Claudio Lavanga is Rome-based producer and correspondent for NBC News.

NBC News decided to try out chatbots in \"The Eternal City.\" Is AI technology the future of travel? 02:29 Link copied April 4, 2023, 10:44 AM UTC By Claudio Lavanga ROME — “When in Rome, do as the Romans do,” the proverb says. But what if you’re only in the Italian capital for just one day and you’re keen to fit in as much of its history and culture as possible? Sure, you could take a few hours out to plan your trip or you could try to book a tour guide to take you round “The Eternal City.” But now there’s a third option: Tourism apps, websites and chatbots that use artificial intelligence to tailor itineraries for the user based on their preferences and time. They’re rapidly popping up, so NBC News decided to put three of them to the test. We decided to try ChatGPT , a quirky chatbot developed by artificial intelligence company OpenAI that was not specifically designed for travel planning. Along with similar programs, its fluency comes for the most part from having been trained on giant troves of text mined from the internet, but it does not have the ability to filter what is accurate or not and has hit the headlines in recent months because of some of its controversial and upsetting responses. We also used iplan.ai, an app you can download to your phone, and usevacay.com, a chatbot and itinerary planner that uses OpenAI's GPT technology to help you tailor your trip. Our choices were based on recommendations from technology websites. Let’s just say the results were mixed at best. Our day started at La Bottega del Caffé, a bar and restaurant in Piazza Madonna dei Monti, a pedestrian square in a bohemian neighborhood near the Colosseum and Forum. Basking in the glorious sunshine of the brisk spring morning, we opened our phones and downloaded iplan.ai, a “smart travel planner” app that claims to produce “a tailor-made travel plan for any kind of trip,” in just a few seconds. With a simple and user-friendly interface, the app allowed us to pick the city, the number of days we were spending there, our interests, our budget and the time of day we wanted to use it. Without using long sentences, it also linked out to Google Maps so you could read reviews. In the time it takes to drink an espresso, a detailed itinerary appeared for the day and into the night, including a list of some of Rome’s most popular landmarks like the Colosseum and Trevi Fountain . Restaurants for lunch and dinner as well as a bar for an evening aperitivo were also among the suggestions. So far, so good. But closer inspection of the timings revealed a flaw. The Pantheon in the historic center of Rome is one of Italy's top tourist sites. Ciancaphoto Studio / Getty Images Sure, you could visit St. Peter’s Square at 3 a.m., but make sure you wear running shoes. You could be chased by Swiss Guards, as at that time the square is well and truly closed. As for the Capitoline Museums, they are definitely not open at 5:30 a.m. Four hours later, you’ll be fine. You could also spend 120 minutes throwing coins into the Trevi Fountain, but your budget would have to be big and one or two over the course of a few minutes would probably suffice. Three hours in the Piazza Navona would probably give enough time to eat at most of the many restaurants there and run a few laps around the square to digest the food. Needless to say, we ignored the timings, but we decided to stick with the itinerary. We headed to the Colosseum nearby, and unsurprisingly, we weren’t the only ones with that idea. The lines were enormous and tickets were sold out when we looked online. At this we opened up ChatGPT and asked it to find us somewhere to go nearby. It suggested the Forum — the ruins of government buildings where elections, trials and processions were held in ancient Rome. Again the lines were enormous, but to be fair to ChatGPT, it is not intended as a real-time reaction tool because its learning data cuts off in 2021 and it cannot provide information about times or the weather. However, it would be helpful if apps and chatbots could tell us about this and provide information about timings and tickets at two of Rome’s biggest attractions. In the end, a little local knowledge saved the day. A walk up a road next to the Forum takes you to a spot where you can see the ancient ruins from a distance. Not ideal, but better than nothing. After the walk, it was definitely time for a little lunch, so we opened usevacay.com and looked for an alternative itinerary for the rest of the day. It also has a chatbot, which helps you narrow down questions so it can provide a more tailored response. The new itinerary recommended “Da Enzo al 29,” a restaurant with a good reputation for genuine Roman dishes and a favorite with the locals in Trastevere, one of the city’s most picturesque neighborhoods. But again we hit a similar problem: long lines. The family-run restaurant doesn’t take bookings, so people were stretched out for at least a block in hopes of getting a table. But luckily a little local knowledge came to our aid once again as Roberto, one of the managers, recognized me as a former customer and without any prompting guided us to a table. Usevacay.com recommended a cacio and pepe, and it was delicious. We followed up with some tiramisu. Tourists also flock to the Colosseum. Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images Feeling like we could use a walk, we went back to usevacay.com. It recommended that we head for the narrow streets of Trastevere, which it said is “lined with colorful buildings and quaint shops.” The streets were narrow, the buildings colorful, but the shops were not so quaint, apart from one selling gelato, overlooking the beautiful Piazza Santa Maria. Carbs and cobblestones are, however, a deadly mix. Time to stop for some culture, so we turned to ChatGPT. “Where can I see some art nearby?” I typed, and we were directed to the Galleria Corsini, an art gallery with paintings from several Italian Renaissance masters, including Caravaggio and Raphael. For once, no line. And after a day thwarted, that’s something to celebrate. Back to usevacay.com to ask about a wine bar, and where better than at Il Goccetto. There we toast the future of travel planning, despite one or two reservations. In fairness, developers are still honing the technology, and they do make it clear that you should treat them as a guide rather than take them as gospel. Asked about some of the pitfalls we encountered, Drew Shepard, CEO of usevacay.com, said in an email that the company recognized “there is always room for improvement.” He added that the company was “actively working on enhancing our user interface to provide a more engaging and accurate experience, incorporating features like embedded links, maps, and better-tailored suggestions.” Salman Taghiakbari, CEO of iplan.ai, said something similar. “While ‘shopping-tourism’ is a challenging area for us, we have plans to make improvements in this area, as well as in ‘gastronomy-tourism’ in version 2 of the app. This next phase will also allow users to book attractions directly through the app,” he said in an email. On Friday, after NBC News’ visit, OpenAI took ChatGPT offline temporarily in Italy after the independent national data agency raised concerns over possible privacy violations and for failing to verify that users were aged 13 or above, as it had requested. A spokesperson for ChatGPT initially pointed us in the direction of its plugins blog . In response to the regulator’s move, the spokesperson said the company is “committed to protecting people’s privacy and we believe we comply with” privacy laws. “Our users in Italy have told us they find ChatGPT helpful for everyday tasks and we look forward to making it available again soon,” they said. Usevacay.com is still working, however. A spokesperson said “we don’t currently collect any of the user input fields nor the resulting outputs.” Of course, it’s all subjective. For me, AI did provide a good starting point, but the technology is not quite there yet. When in Rome ... Claudio Lavanga Claudio Lavanga is Rome-based producer and correspondent for NBC News.

Israeli-Palestinian tensions soar amid new wave of violence 01:16 Link copied April 9, 2023, 12:36 PM UTC By Lawahez Jabari and Leila Sackur JERUSALEM — Israel's military said it struck targets in Syria Sunday, after rare rocket fire from its northern neighbor, as tensions simmered at a volatile Jerusalem shrine important to both Jewish and Muslim worshippers. The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement that fighter jets had hit targets including “military radars systems and artillery posts,” and “a military compound of the Fourth Division of the Syrian Armed Forces.”  This followed strikes on rocket launchers which had fired toward Israeli territory, the statement added. In separate tweets the IDF said six rockets were launched from Syria towards Israel in two separate batches and three had been intercepted. One of the rockets landed in the southern Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, the IDF said. The area borders Syria, which sees the territory as its own. Seized by Israel from Syria during the Six-Day War in 1967, it has been annexed since 1981. It is considered an occupied territory under international law. No damage or casualties were reported in Israeli territory and it was unclear if there were casualties in Syria. Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant later tweeted that he had ordered that crossing from Gaza be closed “until the end of the Jewish Passover holiday,” which concludes Wednesday. “IDF forces will increase the activity of the Israel Police wherever necessary,” he said. His comments came after the Beirut-based Al-Mayadeen TV quoted Al-Quds Brigade, a militia different than the larger Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s armed wing with a similar name, as saying it fired the rockets to retaliate for the police raid on Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque , according to the Associated Press. NBC News was unable to independently verify this. The strikes on the Christian holy day of Easter, came hours before thousands of Jewish worshippers gathered at Jerusalem’s Western Wall, the holiest place where Jews can pray, for a mass priestly benediction prayer service for the Passover holiday. Above the Western Wall, hundreds of Palestinians performed prayers as part of observances during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound. Hundreds of Jews also visited the compound under heavy police guard. The site has been at the center of violent scenes in recent days as Muslim worshippers attempting to stay overnight in the mosque were forcibly removed by Israeli police, who beat worshippers  — including women and children — using batons, chairs and rifles and fired stun guns at youths who hurled firecrackers back. Israeli authorities typically only permit Palestinian worshippers to stay overnight in the mosque during the final 10 days of Ramadan, and regularly enter to evict attendees staying overnight outside of this period. Sitting on a hilltop sacred to both Jews and Muslims , the spot, known to Jews as Temple Mount, is the holiest site in Judaism, revered as the location of biblical Jewish temples. It is also the third-holiest site in Islam. Conflicting claims over the area have frequently spilled out into violence before, most recently in an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas in 2021 in which both sides claimed victory. Israeli-Palestinian tensions soar amid new wave of violence April 7, 2023 01:16 Militant groups in Lebanon and Gaza responded to raids on the al-Aqsa mosque with rocket fire last week and Israel launched a wave of airstrikes on Lebanon and Gaza early Friday after dozens of rockets struck the north of the country the day before. No group claimed responsibility for the rocket fire from Lebanon, although Israel blamed Hamas, and said that it was investigating the involvement of Hezbollah , a Shiite Islamist political party and militant group in Lebanon that also has links to Iran. Elsewhere on Sunday, a large funeral service was held Sunday for    Aaed Azzam Salim 20 who was shot dead during clashes in the town of Azzun in the West Bank. His death Saturday, came less than 24 hours after an Italian tourist was killed in Tel Aviv in a car-ramming attack and two British-Israeli sisters were shot dead and their mother seriously injured in an attack in the West Bank on Friday. Since the start of this year, 95 Palestinians have died including 17 children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Lawahez Jabari reported from Jerusalem and Leila Sackur from London.

His comments came after the Beirut-based Al-Mayadeen TV quoted Al-Quds Brigade, a militia different than the larger Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s armed wing with a similar name, as saying it fired the rockets to retaliate for the police raid on Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque , according to the Associated Press. NBC News was unable to independently verify this. The strikes on the Christian holy day of Easter, came hours before thousands of Jewish worshippers gathered at Jerusalem’s Western Wall, the holiest place where Jews can pray, for a mass priestly benediction prayer service for the Passover holiday. Above the Western Wall, hundreds of Palestinians performed prayers as part of observances during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound. Hundreds of Jews also visited the compound under heavy police guard. The site has been at the center of violent scenes in recent days as Muslim worshippers attempting to stay overnight in the mosque were forcibly removed by Israeli police, who beat worshippers  — including women and children — using batons, chairs and rifles and fired stun guns at youths who hurled firecrackers back. Israeli authorities typically only permit Palestinian worshippers to stay overnight in the mosque during the final 10 days of Ramadan, and regularly enter to evict attendees staying overnight outside of this period. Sitting on a hilltop sacred to both Jews and Muslims , the spot, known to Jews as Temple Mount, is the holiest site in Judaism, revered as the location of biblical Jewish temples. It is also the third-holiest site in Islam. Conflicting claims over the area have frequently spilled out into violence before, most recently in an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas in 2021 in which both sides claimed victory. Israeli-Palestinian tensions soar amid new wave of violence April 7, 2023 01:16 Militant groups in Lebanon and Gaza responded to raids on the al-Aqsa mosque with rocket fire last week and Israel launched a wave of airstrikes on Lebanon and Gaza early Friday after dozens of rockets struck the north of the country the day before. No group claimed responsibility for the rocket fire from Lebanon, although Israel blamed Hamas, and said that it was investigating the involvement of Hezbollah , a Shiite Islamist political party and militant group in Lebanon that also has links to Iran. Elsewhere on Sunday, a large funeral service was held Sunday for    Aaed Azzam Salim 20 who was shot dead during clashes in the town of Azzun in the West Bank. His death Saturday, came less than 24 hours after an Italian tourist was killed in Tel Aviv in a car-ramming attack and two British-Israeli sisters were shot dead and their mother seriously injured in an attack in the West Bank on Friday. Since the start of this year, 95 Palestinians have died including 17 children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Lawahez Jabari reported from Jerusalem and Leila Sackur from London.

China begins military exercises off coast of Taiwan 01:54 Link copied April 9, 2023, 8:32 AM UTC / Source : Reuters By Reuters China’s military simulated precision strikes against Taiwan in a second day of drills around the island on Sunday, with the island’s defence ministry reporting multiple air force sorties and that it was monitoring China’s missile forces. China, which claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, began three days of military exercises around the island on Saturday, the day after Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen returned from a brief visit to the United States. Chinese state television reported that the combat readiness patrols and drills around Taiwan were continuing. “Under the unified command of the theatre joint operations command centre, multiple types of units carried out simulated joint precision strikes on key targets on Taiwan island and the surrounding sea areas, and continue to maintain an offensive posture around the island,” it said. A Taiwan security source told Reuters that on Saturday the Chinese drills around the Bashi Channel, which separates Taiwan from the Philippines, included simulated attacks on aircraft carrier groups as well as anti-submarine drills. A Taiwanese fighter jet is seen on final approach for landing at an air force base in Hsinchu, northern Taiwan on Sunday. JAMESON WU / AFP - Getty Images Taiwan’s defence ministry said that as of Sunday midday local time (11 p.m ET Saturday) they had spotted 58 Chinese aircraft, including Su-30 fighters and H-6 bombers, as well as nine ships, around Taiwan. The ministry said they were paying particular attention to the People’s Liberation Army’s Rocket Force which is in charge of China’s land-based missile system. “Regarding the movements of the Chinese communists’ Rocket Force, the nation’s military also has a close grasp through the joint intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance system, and air defence forces remain on high alert,” the ministry said. It reiterated that Taiwan’s forces will “not escalate conflicts nor cause disputes” and would respond “appropriately” to China’s drills. Life in Taiwan has continued as normal, with no sign of panic or disruption from the Chinese drills. Last August, following a visit to Taipei by Nancy Pelosi , then the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, China staged war games around Taiwan, including firing missiles into waters close to the island. It has not announced similar drills this time. While in Los Angeles last week, on what was officially billed a transit on her way back from Central America, Tsai met the current speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, despite Beijing’s warnings against it. The de facto U.S. embassy in Taiwan said on Sunday the United States was monitoring China’s drills around Taiwan closely and is “comfortable and confident” it has sufficient resources and capabilities regionally to ensure peace and stability. U.S. channels of communication with China remain open and the United States had consistently urged restraint and no change to the status quo, said a spokesperson for the American Institute in Taiwan, which serves as an embassy in the absence of formal diplomatic ties. Washington severed diplomatic relations with Taipei in favour of Beijing in 1979 but is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. China, which has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control, says Taiwan is the most important and sensitive issue in its relations with the United States, and the topic is a frequent source of tensions. Beijing considers Tsai a separatist and has rebuffed her repeated calls for talks. Tsai says only Taiwan’s people can decide their future. China has over the past three years or so stepped up its military pressure against Taiwan , flying regular missions around Taiwan, though not in its territorial air space or over the island itself. Taiwan’s defence ministry said earlier on Sunday that in the previous 24 hours it had spotted 71 Chinese air force aircraft and nine navy vessels around Taiwan. The ministry published a map showing around half of those aircraft, including Su-30s and J-11s, crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait , which has for years served as an unofficial barrier between the two sides. Chinese state media said the aircraft were armed with live weapons. Taiwanese air force jets also typically carry live weapons when they scramble to see off Chinese incursions. Putin's Ukraine invasion 'woke up the Taiwanese people,' McCaul says April 8, 2023 01:35 Late on Saturday, Taiwan’s Ocean Affairs Council, which runs the Coast Guard, put out footage on its YouTube channel showing one of its ships shadowing a Chinese warship, though did not give an exact location. “You are seriously harming regional peace, stability and security. Please immediately turn around and leave. If you continue to proceed we will take expulsion measures,” a Coast Guard officer says by radio to the Chinese ship. Other footage showed a Taiwanese warship, the Di Hua, accompanying the Coast Guard ship in what the Coast Guard officer calls a “standoff” with the Chinese warship. Still, civilian flights around Taiwan, including to Kinmen and Matsu, two groups of Taiwan-controlled islands right next to the Chinese coast, have continued as normal. In August, civilian air traffic was disrupted after China announced effective no-fly zones in several blocks close to Taiwan where it was firing missiles.

Israeli-Palestinian tensions soar amid new wave of violence 01:16 Link copied April 8, 2023, 2:40 PM UTC By Leila Sackur After Israel launched its biggest airstrikes on Lebanon in 17 years, tensions in the region remained high Saturday after two Israeli sisters were shot dead in the West Bank and at an Italian tourist was killed in a car-ramming attack in Tel Aviv. Israeli police said in a series of tweets on Friday that the car plowed into a group of people near a popular bike and walking path in Tel Aviv and overturned. The driver was shot dead by a nearby police officer who noticed him “trying to reach for what looked like a rifle-like object,” police said. They added that the driver was 45 years old, and a resident of Kfar Kasem, a small town about 14 miles west of Tel Aviv. Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni identified the victim as Alessandro Parini, in a tweet. She did not provide any more details about him. “Closeness to the victim’s family, to the wounded and solidarity with the State of Israel for the cowardly attack that hit him,” she wrote. The Magen David Adom emergency service said in a statement that five others were transported to the hospital in moderate to mild condition. It added that all of them were tourists. The ramming came hours after two Israeli sisters, 20 and 16 years old who had joint British nationality were shot dead in an attack on their car near the Jewish settlement of Hamra in the occupied West Bank, the Israeli military said. Their mother was also seriously injured. No groups have claimed responsibility for either attack, but Hamas , a militant group that runs Gaza praised both incidents as retaliation for Israeli raids and violence in al-Aqsa mosque in east Jersualem earlier this week. Islamic Jihad issued a similar statement. As soldiers hunted for the gunman, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered border police reserves and additional military forces to be mobilized to confront the wave of attacks. The State Department condemned both attacks in a statement in which it reaffirmed America's “ enduring commitment to [Israel’s] security ,” and added that “the targeting of innocent civilians of any nationality is unconscionable.” The U.K.’s foreign office said it was “saddened to hear about the deaths of two British-Israeli citizens and the serious injuries sustained by a third individual” and called for “all parties” to de-escalate tensions. At least one dead, six wounded in attack on Tel Aviv Promenade April 7, 2023 02:47 Both attacks came less than 24 hours after Israel launched a wave of  airstrikes on Lebanon and Gaza early Friday after dozens of rockets struck the north of the country. The exchanges, which came during the Jewish Passover holiday, the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and in the run-up to the Christian holy day of Easter represent the most serious escalation between Israel and Lebanon since a 34-day war in 2006 . No group claimed responsibility for the rocket fire, although Israel blamed Hamas, and said that it was investigating the involvement of Hezbollah , a Shia Islamist political party and militant group in Lebanon that also has links to Iran. The Israeli military was quick to emphasize that airstrikes targeted only areas linked to Palestinian militants. In Lebanon, missiles struck an open field near the southern town of Qalili near a Palestinian refugee camp , according to the Associated Press. The Palestinian Authority said that Israeli attacks in Gaza damaged a children’s hospital, in contravention of the Geneva Convention. Israel said that it would hold Lebanon responsible for any “hostile fire” emerging from the territory, including that which it suspected came from non-governmental militant groups. Lebanon’s foreign ministry said Friday said in a statement that the attack “constitutes a flagrant violation of Lebanon’s sovereignty,” and added that its permanent mission to the United Nations in New York would submit an official complaint over the bombing. The escalation came after Israeli police raided al-Aqsa mosque twice earlier this week, as worshippers barricaded themselves into the mosque’s compound to pray during the holy month of Ramadan. Police stormed the compound and fired stun guns at Palestinian youths who hurled firecrackers back early Wednesday morning. Inside the mosque, police beat worshippers — including women and children — using batons, chairs and rifles, people detained at the scene told the Associated Press. Fifty people were injured in the raid, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. Al-Aqsa mosque sits on a hilltop sacred to both Jews and Muslims. The spot, known to Jews as Temple Mount, is the holiest site in Judaism, revered as the location of biblical Jewish temples. It is also the third-holiest site in Islam. Conflicting claims over the area have frequently spilled out into violence before, most recently in an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas in 2021 in which both sides claimed victory. Israeli police did not comment on the beatings, but said security forces entered the compound in response to “masked suspects pelting rocks” toward officers stationed at the compound’s gates.

Israeli-Palestinian tensions soar amid new wave of violence 01:16 Link copied April 8, 2023, 2:40 PM UTC By Leila Sackur After Israel launched its biggest airstrikes on Lebanon in 17 years, tensions in the region remained high Saturday after two Israeli sisters were shot dead in the West Bank and at an Italian tourist was killed in a car-ramming attack in Tel Aviv. Israeli police said in a series of tweets on Friday that the car plowed into a group of people near a popular bike and walking path in Tel Aviv and overturned. The driver was shot dead by a nearby police officer who noticed him “trying to reach for what looked like a rifle-like object,” police said. They added that the driver was 45 years old, and a resident of Kfar Kasem, a small town about 14 miles west of Tel Aviv. Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni identified the victim as Alessandro Parini, in a tweet. She did not provide any more details about him. “Closeness to the victim’s family, to the wounded and solidarity with the State of Israel for the cowardly attack that hit him,” she wrote. The Magen David Adom emergency service said in a statement that five others were transported to the hospital in moderate to mild condition. It added that all of them were tourists. The ramming came hours after two Israeli sisters, 20 and 16 years old who had joint British nationality were shot dead in an attack on their car near the Jewish settlement of Hamra in the occupied West Bank, the Israeli military said. Their mother was also seriously injured. No groups have claimed responsibility for either attack, but Hamas , a militant group that runs Gaza praised both incidents as retaliation for Israeli raids and violence in al-Aqsa mosque in east Jersualem earlier this week. Islamic Jihad issued a similar statement. As soldiers hunted for the gunman, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered border police reserves and additional military forces to be mobilized to confront the wave of attacks. The State Department condemned both attacks in a statement in which it reaffirmed America's “ enduring commitment to [Israel’s] security ,” and added that “the targeting of innocent civilians of any nationality is unconscionable.” The U.K.’s foreign office said it was “saddened to hear about the deaths of two British-Israeli citizens and the serious injuries sustained by a third individual” and called for “all parties” to de-escalate tensions. At least one dead, six wounded in attack on Tel Aviv Promenade April 7, 2023 02:47 Both attacks came less than 24 hours after Israel launched a wave of  airstrikes on Lebanon and Gaza early Friday after dozens of rockets struck the north of the country. The exchanges, which came during the Jewish Passover holiday, the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and in the run-up to the Christian holy day of Easter represent the most serious escalation between Israel and Lebanon since a 34-day war in 2006 . No group claimed responsibility for the rocket fire, although Israel blamed Hamas, and said that it was investigating the involvement of Hezbollah , a Shia Islamist political party and militant group in Lebanon that also has links to Iran. The Israeli military was quick to emphasize that airstrikes targeted only areas linked to Palestinian militants. In Lebanon, missiles struck an open field near the southern town of Qalili near a Palestinian refugee camp , according to the Associated Press. The Palestinian Authority said that Israeli attacks in Gaza damaged a children’s hospital, in contravention of the Geneva Convention. Israel said that it would hold Lebanon responsible for any “hostile fire” emerging from the territory, including that which it suspected came from non-governmental militant groups. Lebanon’s foreign ministry said Friday said in a statement that the attack “constitutes a flagrant violation of Lebanon’s sovereignty,” and added that its permanent mission to the United Nations in New York would submit an official complaint over the bombing. The escalation came after Israeli police raided al-Aqsa mosque twice earlier this week, as worshippers barricaded themselves into the mosque’s compound to pray during the holy month of Ramadan. Police stormed the compound and fired stun guns at Palestinian youths who hurled firecrackers back early Wednesday morning. Inside the mosque, police beat worshippers — including women and children — using batons, chairs and rifles, people detained at the scene told the Associated Press. Fifty people were injured in the raid, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. Al-Aqsa mosque sits on a hilltop sacred to both Jews and Muslims. The spot, known to Jews as Temple Mount, is the holiest site in Judaism, revered as the location of biblical Jewish temples. It is also the third-holiest site in Islam. Conflicting claims over the area have frequently spilled out into violence before, most recently in an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas in 2021 in which both sides claimed victory. Israeli police did not comment on the beatings, but said security forces entered the compound in response to “masked suspects pelting rocks” toward officers stationed at the compound’s gates.

A construction worker looks out at the site of Indonesia’s new capital city, Nusantara, in March. Mast Irham / EPA via Shutterstock Link copied April 8, 2023, 11:00 AM UTC By Richaldo Hariandja BALIKPAPAN, Indonesia — As the small red car came to a halt, the window slid down and a hand emerged, tossing some yellow crackers on the ground. Seconds later, a group of southern pig-tailed macaques, a monkey species native to the island of Borneo, swarmed the area and devoured the food in an instant. Until recently, this road in the wilds of Indonesia was seldom used by either people or macaques, an endangered species that spends most of its time in trees. But with its repairs as part of the  development of a new national capital, Nusantara, it is drawing macaques who have discovered the road’s new users are a reliable source of food. “They were rarely seen before that,” said Satwika Satria Prahita, a resident of the nearby port city of Balikpapan. The Indonesian government says the new capital is necessary because the 11 million residents of the congested current capital, Jakarta, face environmental threats including pollution, sinking land and rising seas. Construction has started on the chosen site 1,200 miles away in Borneo, an island shared by Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei that has some of the world’s highest levels of biodiversity. Officials say Nusantara will adopt a “forest city” concept, in which more than 75% of the area is green space, and that it will be carbon neutral by the time construction is completed is 2045. But conservationists worry about the impact on orangutans, dolphins and other wildlife in and around the new capital, citing the public’s lack of conservation knowledge. Nusantara is set to be inaugurated next August, but construction is not expected to be completed until 2045. Rony Zakaria / Bloomberg via Getty Images “Our big homework now is figuring out how to educate the people,” said Hadi S. Alikodra, a professor in the faculty of forestry and environment at IPB University in Bogor, Indonesia. Experts have urged the government to protect wildlife from construction workers, as well as the 1.9 million people who are expected to eventually live in Nusantara, which is set to be inaugurated in August next year. Otherwise, there could be some disastrous conflicts between humans and animals, said Muhammad Ali Imron, a wildlife expert at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. “And it will lead to biodiversity loss,” he said. Wiratno, an official with the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, acknowledged the concerns but said the government was making wildlife protection a top priority. “We will intensively educate the workers and all of the people about conservation and how to live among wildlife in this forest city,” said Wiratno, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. He said Nusantara’s 75% forest cover would make it an attractive place for animals to live. As a safeguard against conflict between  humans and animals, he said, the government is establishing a wildlife response unit and call center. Some of those potential conflicts can be dangerous. Conservationists say large-scale mangrove clearings and an increase in activity by large ships have already spurred crocodile attacks on local fishermen, putting them in a bind. “If I can choose, I would rather go fishing in daylight to avoid encounters with crocodiles,” said Hasanudin, a fisherman in the village of Gersik. “But the outcome will be less than doing it at night or before dawn.” A rainforest in Balikpapan, located in eastern Borneo. The island has some of the world’s highest levels of biodiversity. Adek Berry / AFP via Getty Images According to the Indonesian Ministry of National Development Planning, the new capital — whose name means “archipelago” — could one day encompass almost 1,000 square miles of East Kalimantan province, or four times the size of Jakarta. About 125 square miles of that land is classified as primary forest that has been untouched by human activity, according to Auriga, an Indonesian nongovernmental organization focused on biodiversity. There are also about 75 square miles of mangroves, about three-quarters of which is considered nonforest, meaning it can be converted for agricultural, residential or industrial use. Mangroves are the natural habitat for the proboscis monkey, a primate native to Borneo that has been classified as endangered since 2015. “You can’t find the monkey anywhere but in Indonesia,” Alikodra said. About 1,400 proboscis monkeys live in the mangroves of Balikpapan Bay, or 5% of the total population in Borneo, according to a coalition of local civil society groups. The bay, which will serve as Nusantara’s harbor, is also home to the Irrawaddy dolphin, another critically endangered species. According to the most recent survey by the Conservation Foundation for Rare Aquatic Species of Indonesia, there were only 71 dolphins left in the area in 2015. The escalated activity in Balikpapan Bay, either during construction or once Nusantara is populated, is likely to put stress on the dolphins’ environment, the coalition said, pointing to a 2018 oil spill that killed four of the creatures.

Rony Zakaria / Bloomberg via Getty Images Another endangered species that could be affected by the Nusantara project is orangutans, about 200 of whom live in a local sanctuary. Aldrijanto Priadjati, East Kalimantan program manager for the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation, said the new capital would consume all of the sanctuary’s 28 square miles. He said the Nusantara project was an opportunity for officials to demonstrate their commitment to orangutan protection. “We welcome the project with open arms, and (are) open to help the government establish safeguards for these orangutans,” Priadjati  said. Medrilzam, director of environmental affairs at the Ministry of National Development Planning, said the Nusantara project would create environmental solutions rather than problems. “We have carefully planned this project in all aspects, including the environment,” said Medrilzam, who also goes by one name. He said he was confident that no mangroves would be converted and the orangutan sanctuary would be unaffected. “We will protect these iconic ecosystems,” he said.

Pope Francis encourages hope amid ‘icy winds of war’ during Easter vigil Mass 01:14 Link copied April 8, 2023, 7:17 PM UTC By Associated Press VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis returned to public view on Saturday, presiding over Easter vigil Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica, a day after unseasonably chilly weather in Rome convinced the recently ailing pontiff to skip Good Friday’s nighttime procession at the Colosseum. The evening basilica service began in darkness. Then the basilica’s cavernous interior was suddenly bathed in light, reflecting the Christian beliefs that Jesus rose from his death by crucifixion and that goodness can triumph over evil. The 86-year-old pope is recuperating from bronchitis, which saw him recently hospitalized for three days. On Sunday, tens of thousands of faithful are expected to join the pope in St. Peter’s Square for Easter Mass and to listen to his speech about conflicts in the world at the end of Holy Week. At the start of the Easter vigil, Francis, who arrived in a wheelchair he uses to cope with knee pain, incised in the wax of a tall candle a cross, the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet — alpha and omega — and the numerals of this year. Then the lit candle was carried by a cleric up the basilica’s center aisle, past darkened pews filled with faithful. Dozens of cardinals and other prelates followed, each carrying a smaller, lit candle. “The Church calls upon her sons and daughters, scattered throughout the world, to come together to watch and pray,’’ Francis said, beginning the service. The basilica Mass during the vigil of Christianity’s most important day has become an occasion for pontiffs to baptize several adults from around the world. Selected to be baptized at this year’s vigil were eight believers, from Albania, the United States, Nigeria, Italy and Venezuela, the Vatican said.

People watch the news of North Korea's underwater attack drone at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea, on Saturday. Lee Jin-man / AP Link copied April 8, 2023, 2:19 PM UTC / Source : Associated Press By Associated Press North Korea on Saturday claimed it tested this week a second known type of nuclear-capable underwater attack drone designed to destroy naval vessels and ports, adding to a flurry of weapons demonstrations this year that have heightened tensions with rivals. The report of the four-day test came a day after the nuclear envoys of the United States, South Korea and Japan met in Seoul to discuss the growing North Korean nuclear threat and called for stronger international efforts to crack down on illicit North Korean activities funding its weapons program. The North’s official Korean Central News Agency said the drone, named “Haeil-2” after a Korean word meaning tsunamis or tidal waves, traveled underwater for more than 71 hours before successfully detonating a mock warhead in waters near the eastern port city of Tanchon on Friday. KCNA said the test proved that the weapon could strike targets 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) away with “fatal attack ability.” North Korean state media last month reported two tests of another drone, named “Haeil-1,” and described the weapon as capable of setting off a “ radioactive tsunami ” to destroy enemy vessels and ports. Analysts, however, are skeptical whether such a device would add a meaningful new threat to North Korea’s growing nuclear arsenal built around missiles and whether it’s reasonable for the North to pursue such capabilities considering its still-limited supplies of nuclear bomb fuel. South Korea’s military has said it believes North Korean claims about Haeil-1 were likely “exaggerated or fabricated.” Tensions ramp up as North Korea test-launches multiple cruise missiles March 22, 2023 05:03 On Friday, U.S. President Joe Biden’s special representative for North Korea, Sung Kim, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul where they issued a joint statement calling for stronger international support to stem North Korean efforts to evade U.N. Security Council sanctions imposed over its nuclear weapons ambitions. The envoys expressed particular concern about North Korea’s cybercrimes and illicit labor exports, which Seoul says could possibly expand as it further reopens its borders as COVID-19 fears ease. North Korea in 2023 alone fired around 30 missiles in 11 different launch events, including an intercontinental ballistic missile that demonstrated potential range to reach the U.S. mainland and several shorter-range weapons designed to deliver nuclear strikes on South Korean targets.

Six ways the fight to ban it could play out The uncertainty around a TikTok ban has left the app’s millions of users and critics with an open question: What’s going to happen to it? A TikTok creator holds a sign supporting the company during a news conference outside the Capitol on March 22. Nathan Howard / Bloomberg via Getty Images Link copied April 8, 2023, 9:40 PM UTC By David Ingram and Daysia Tolentino TikTok is in a kind of limbo. The Biden administration has threatened to ban the popular video app in the United States because of security concerns with its Chinese owners. But there’s no deadline for the White House to make a decision, and Congress might want to have a say in the matter. The uncertainty has left the app’s millions of users and its critics with an open question: What’s going to happen to TikTok? There are a handful of possibilities, and while the timeline is unclear, here’s a guide to six plausible paths forward. Scenario 1: Congress dooms TikTok Then-President Donald Trump tried to ban TikTok in 2020 and failed in large part because courts ruled he didn’t have the legal authority. Now, Congress is thinking of giving that power to President Joe Biden. A bipartisan group of senators introduced a bill last month that would give the U.S. commerce secretary broad power to regulate or ban technology from six countries including China. They’re calling it the Restricting the Emergence of Security Threats That Risk Information and Communications Technology Act, or RESTRICT Act. There are lots of questions about how a TikTok ban might work, but the RESTRICT Act is sweeping in its language , saying the commerce secretary “shall take action” to mitigate certain risks. The bill also doesn’t leave much wiggle room for deliberation, saying the secretary shouldn’t take more than 180 days to determine if something is an “unacceptable risk.” Bipartisan opposition to banning TikTok emerges on Capitol Hill March 30, 2023 03:38 In defending this path forward, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., one of the sponsors, said similar laws are proliferating globally. “Nations across the globe have made steps to mitigate foreign tech. The U.S. isn’t the only country acting on this,” he tweeted Thursday. The bill is a long way from becoming law, but it already has the backing of a quarter of the Senate. In this scenario, if the House and Senate pass it, a ban could become a reality less than a year after Congress acts. Scenario 2: Congress doesn’t act, but Biden bans it anyway Not every senator is rushing to endorse a TikTok ban. Last month, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., blocked an attempt to fast-track the RESTRICT Act, citing free expression. “Have faith that our desire for freedom is strong enough to survive a few dance videos,” Paul said . If Congress doesn’t pass the bill, the Biden administration could still try to restrict or ban TikTok using its current legal authority. A federal government board known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has already privately demanded that TikTok’s Chinese owners sell their stakes in the app, The Wall Street Journal has reported , citing anonymous sources whom it described as people familiar with the matter. NBC News has not confirmed that reporting. The next step, in this scenario, might be an executive order from Biden echoing what Trump issued in 2020. State governors have already been going down that path . But this path involves a lot of legal and political risk for the White House. It would likely need to defend the ban in court — something Trump tried and failed to do in 2020 — and it wouldn’t have the political cover of acting in concert with Congress. Scenario 3: Biden does something small, or nothing at all The idea of a TikTok ban has been floating around since before Biden took office more than two years ago, and he hasn’t done it. So, one scenario is that he never does. The administration and TikTok have been locked in negotiations for years over a potential written agreement that would lay out certain steps for TikTok to follow to help secure the data of Americans and prevent the flow of Chinese propaganda. It could be that those talks result in something that satisfies Biden. Or it could be that other parts of the U.S.-China relationship — the future of Taiwan or the competition for artificial intelligence — take precedence, and the threat of TikTok fades. TikTok has been bolstering its defenses in hopes of reaching a deal. TikTok creators have visited Washington, D.C.; TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew has testified before Congress; and TikTok has pushed an endeavor that it calls Project Texas — working with Austin-based Oracle to store Americans’ data on U.S. soil. Scenario 4: Judges protect TikTok The courts came to TikTok’s rescue in 2020 when the Trump administration tried to restrict the app, as two federal judges in separate lawsuits said the administration had likely overstepped its legal authority and blocked the restrictions. Judge Wendy Beetlestone, an Obama appointee in Philadelphia, sided with TikTok users who were concerned about free expression, while Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee in Washington, D.C., based his ruling on federal regulatory law in a suit that TikTok itself filed. Similar concerns would likely be at issue again if TikTok or its users were to sue, either after a White House move or ahead of time in order to pre-empt it. “Banning TikTok would violate the First Amendment,” Jenna Leventoff, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement last month. “The government can’t impose this type of total ban unless it’s necessary to prevent extremely serious, immediate harm to national security.” TikTok’s success in court isn’t guaranteed, but if it could at least delay any restrictions, that would be some kind of win. And if TikTok or its users wanted to take that path again, they’ll have even more legal muscle the second time around: TikTok has been on a hiring spree for lawyers in the past three years and has plans to hire many more lawyers, Bloomberg Law reported last month, citing eight recent hires and more open positions listed on a TikTok jobs board . Scenario 5: ByteDance sells it A spinoff of TikTok’s U.S. business from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, would in some ways be the easiest path to take. It would avoid the messy political and legal fights over a ban, and users might not notice a difference. And ByteDance is already owned mostly by outsiders. More than 60% of shares are in the hands of “Western investment firms” such as Sequoia Capital, Fidelity and BlackRock, according to congressional testimony last year from Vanessa Pappas, TikTok’s chief operating officer. Founders and employees own “most of the rest,” she said. G42, an investment firm from the United Arab Emirates, bought shares last month , Bloomberg News reported, citing people with knowledge of the deal. China hopes to block this path. Beijing has said it would “ resolutely oppose ” a sale, arguing it would damage investors and hurt confidence for others investing in the United States. China also imposed export restrictions in 2020 that might complicate the transfer of TikTok’s algorithms, although how the rules might apply isn’t clear , according to CNBC. TikTok’s leadership considers a sale a last resort, Bloomberg News reported last month , citing people familiar with the matter. Its U.S. business could pursue either an initial public offering as a standalone company or a sale to a large tech firm such as Microsoft at a valuation of perhaps $40 billion to $50 billion, the news service said. Scenario 6: Congress passes a privacy law for all apps As privacy advocates are always quick to note, the U.S. doesn’t have a national law for privacy on the internet as some other countries do . One scenario is that Congress passes one in the near future, possibly taking some of the heat off TikTok. It’s not entirely far-fetched. Negotiators in the Senate have bargained for years on a possible bipartisan data privacy law, and they seemed to get close to a breakthrough last summer before splintering over how such a law would be enforced. India McKinney, director of federal affairs at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy advocacy group based in San Francisco, said a privacy law wouldn’t have the constitutional issues that a ban might. “If the government is actually concerned with the amount of data that foreign companies like TikTok are collecting on Americans and then using it for whatever, then what they actually really need to do is have a comprehensive data privacy rule because that is what will prevent the collection of the information in the first place,” McKinney said in an interview. It’s not clear whether such a law would satisfy security concerns about TikTok, and it doesn’t preclude simultaneous actions like a TikTok ban, but supporters of the idea say it would put TikTok on similar footing to competitors such as Instagram, YouTube and Snapchat.

Six ways the fight to ban it could play out The uncertainty around a TikTok ban has left the app’s millions of users and critics with an open question: What’s going to happen to it? A TikTok creator holds a sign supporting the company during a news conference outside the Capitol on March 22. Nathan Howard / Bloomberg via Getty Images Link copied April 8, 2023, 9:40 PM UTC By David Ingram and Daysia Tolentino TikTok is in a kind of limbo. The Biden administration has threatened to ban the popular video app in the United States because of security concerns with its Chinese owners. But there’s no deadline for the White House to make a decision, and Congress might want to have a say in the matter. The uncertainty has left the app’s millions of users and its critics with an open question: What’s going to happen to TikTok? There are a handful of possibilities, and while the timeline is unclear, here’s a guide to six plausible paths forward. Scenario 1: Congress dooms TikTok Then-President Donald Trump tried to ban TikTok in 2020 and failed in large part because courts ruled he didn’t have the legal authority. Now, Congress is thinking of giving that power to President Joe Biden. A bipartisan group of senators introduced a bill last month that would give the U.S. commerce secretary broad power to regulate or ban technology from six countries including China. They’re calling it the Restricting the Emergence of Security Threats That Risk Information and Communications Technology Act, or RESTRICT Act. There are lots of questions about how a TikTok ban might work, but the RESTRICT Act is sweeping in its language , saying the commerce secretary “shall take action” to mitigate certain risks. The bill also doesn’t leave much wiggle room for deliberation, saying the secretary shouldn’t take more than 180 days to determine if something is an “unacceptable risk.” Bipartisan opposition to banning TikTok emerges on Capitol Hill March 30, 2023 03:38 In defending this path forward, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., one of the sponsors, said similar laws are proliferating globally. “Nations across the globe have made steps to mitigate foreign tech. The U.S. isn’t the only country acting on this,” he tweeted Thursday. The bill is a long way from becoming law, but it already has the backing of a quarter of the Senate. In this scenario, if the House and Senate pass it, a ban could become a reality less than a year after Congress acts. Scenario 2: Congress doesn’t act, but Biden bans it anyway Not every senator is rushing to endorse a TikTok ban. Last month, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., blocked an attempt to fast-track the RESTRICT Act, citing free expression. “Have faith that our desire for freedom is strong enough to survive a few dance videos,” Paul said . If Congress doesn’t pass the bill, the Biden administration could still try to restrict or ban TikTok using its current legal authority. A federal government board known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has already privately demanded that TikTok’s Chinese owners sell their stakes in the app, The Wall Street Journal has reported , citing anonymous sources whom it described as people familiar with the matter. NBC News has not confirmed that reporting. The next step, in this scenario, might be an executive order from Biden echoing what Trump issued in 2020. State governors have already been going down that path . But this path involves a lot of legal and political risk for the White House. It would likely need to defend the ban in court — something Trump tried and failed to do in 2020 — and it wouldn’t have the political cover of acting in concert with Congress. Scenario 3: Biden does something small, or nothing at all The idea of a TikTok ban has been floating around since before Biden took office more than two years ago, and he hasn’t done it. So, one scenario is that he never does. The administration and TikTok have been locked in negotiations for years over a potential written agreement that would lay out certain steps for TikTok to follow to help secure the data of Americans and prevent the flow of Chinese propaganda. It could be that those talks result in something that satisfies Biden. Or it could be that other parts of the U.S.-China relationship — the future of Taiwan or the competition for artificial intelligence — take precedence, and the threat of TikTok fades. TikTok has been bolstering its defenses in hopes of reaching a deal. TikTok creators have visited Washington, D.C.; TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew has testified before Congress; and TikTok has pushed an endeavor that it calls Project Texas — working with Austin-based Oracle to store Americans’ data on U.S. soil. Scenario 4: Judges protect TikTok The courts came to TikTok’s rescue in 2020 when the Trump administration tried to restrict the app, as two federal judges in separate lawsuits said the administration had likely overstepped its legal authority and blocked the restrictions. Judge Wendy Beetlestone, an Obama appointee in Philadelphia, sided with TikTok users who were concerned about free expression, while Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee in Washington, D.C., based his ruling on federal regulatory law in a suit that TikTok itself filed. Similar concerns would likely be at issue again if TikTok or its users were to sue, either after a White House move or ahead of time in order to pre-empt it. “Banning TikTok would violate the First Amendment,” Jenna Leventoff, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement last month. “The government can’t impose this type of total ban unless it’s necessary to prevent extremely serious, immediate harm to national security.” TikTok’s success in court isn’t guaranteed, but if it could at least delay any restrictions, that would be some kind of win. And if TikTok or its users wanted to take that path again, they’ll have even more legal muscle the second time around: TikTok has been on a hiring spree for lawyers in the past three years and has plans to hire many more lawyers, Bloomberg Law reported last month, citing eight recent hires and more open positions listed on a TikTok jobs board . Scenario 5: ByteDance sells it A spinoff of TikTok’s U.S. business from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, would in some ways be the easiest path to take. It would avoid the messy political and legal fights over a ban, and users might not notice a difference. And ByteDance is already owned mostly by outsiders. More than 60% of shares are in the hands of “Western investment firms” such as Sequoia Capital, Fidelity and BlackRock, according to congressional testimony last year from Vanessa Pappas, TikTok’s chief operating officer. Founders and employees own “most of the rest,” she said. G42, an investment firm from the United Arab Emirates, bought shares last month , Bloomberg News reported, citing people with knowledge of the deal. China hopes to block this path. Beijing has said it would “ resolutely oppose ” a sale, arguing it would damage investors and hurt confidence for others investing in the United States. China also imposed export restrictions in 2020 that might complicate the transfer of TikTok’s algorithms, although how the rules might apply isn’t clear , according to CNBC. TikTok’s leadership considers a sale a last resort, Bloomberg News reported last month , citing people familiar with the matter. Its U.S. business could pursue either an initial public offering as a standalone company or a sale to a large tech firm such as Microsoft at a valuation of perhaps $40 billion to $50 billion, the news service said. Scenario 6: Congress passes a privacy law for all apps As privacy advocates are always quick to note, the U.S. doesn’t have a national law for privacy on the internet as some other countries do . One scenario is that Congress passes one in the near future, possibly taking some of the heat off TikTok. It’s not entirely far-fetched. Negotiators in the Senate have bargained for years on a possible bipartisan data privacy law, and they seemed to get close to a breakthrough last summer before splintering over how such a law would be enforced. India McKinney, director of federal affairs at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy advocacy group based in San Francisco, said a privacy law wouldn’t have the constitutional issues that a ban might. “If the government is actually concerned with the amount of data that foreign companies like TikTok are collecting on Americans and then using it for whatever, then what they actually really need to do is have a comprehensive data privacy rule because that is what will prevent the collection of the information in the first place,” McKinney said in an interview. It’s not clear whether such a law would satisfy security concerns about TikTok, and it doesn’t preclude simultaneous actions like a TikTok ban, but supporters of the idea say it would put TikTok on similar footing to competitors such as Instagram, YouTube and Snapchat.

Link copied April 9, 2023, 12:46 PM UTC By Dan Avery Gay, lesbian and bisexual youths are at far greater risk of sleep problems than their straight counterparts, according to a new study published in the journal LGBT Health. Researchers analyzed data on more than 8,500 young people ages 10 to 14, a critical time for mental and physical development. They found that 35.1% of those who identified as gay, lesbian or bisexual reported trouble falling or staying asleep in the previous two weeks, compared to 13.5% of straight-identifying adolescents. In addition, 30.8% of questioning youths — those who answered “maybe” to being gay, lesbian or bisexual — reported problems with getting a full night’s rest. “Sleep is incredibly important for a teenager’s health,” said lead author Jason M. Nagata, a professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco. “There’s growth spurts and hormonal changes that help you develop normally.” Most kids don't get quality sleep to begin with, Nagata said, but LGBTQ youths can face bullying and discrimination at school or conflicts at home that contribute to mental health issues. Those problems can keep them from falling or staying asleep. “It’s likely that one feeds off the other — poor sleep worsening mental health issues, and mental health issues worsening sleep,” said Dr. Matthew Hirschtritt, a psychiatrist and researcher with Kaiser Permanente who did not work on this study. Adolescents who get insufficient sleep may also have difficulty completing schoolwork and facing other academic challenges, Hirschtritt added, “which can exacerbate some of the school-based problems that LGBT youth already face.” Nagata’s team used data from 2018 to 2020 from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study , which included questions for both the subjects and their parents about their sleep habits. Existing research already points to increased sleep issues among sexual minorities, but Nagata said he believes this is the first time gay, lesbian and bisexual youths have been the focus. “This is such a volatile period, both physically and mentally,” he said. “Teens are particularly vulnerable to the opinions of their peers, so it's a high-risk group for mental health problems and suicide.” Further research could illuminate other factors fueling sleep disorders among queer youths, he said. “LGB kids experience more substance use than their peers, for example, which can alter sleep cycles and impair sleep,” he said. Overstimulation and stress can also affect sleep. Separate research Nagata has worked on indicates gay youths use screens an average of nearly four hours a day more than straight kids. He recommends teenagers establish consistent sleep schedules, make sure their sleeping environments are comfortable and limit their exposure to electronic devices and social media before bed. Co-author Kyle T. Ganson, a professor at the University of Toronto’s Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work, said parents can also help by being actively involved in their children’s lives and supportive of their identities and any feelings they may be exploring. “Adolescent development is a challenging time for many given the social pressures and physical, psychological and emotional changes that occur,” Ganson said in a statement. “Understanding this process and being present to support it is crucial for positive health outcomes.” Dan Avery About Contact Help Careers Ad Choices Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Personal Information CA Notice Terms of Service NBC News Sitemap Advertise Select Shopping Select Personal Finance © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL NBC News Logo MSNBC Logo Today Logo\n",

Tiger Woods on the 18th hole during the second round of the Masters golf tournament on Saturday in Augusta, Ga. Charlie Riedel / AP Link copied April 9, 2023, 1:22 PM UTC By Associated Press AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) — Tiger Woods withdrew from the Masters before the resumption of the third round because of an injury Sunday, ending his streak of completing all 72 holes of every tournament he has played at Augusta National as a professional. The tournament announced about 90 minutes before play began that Woods, who is still hobbled by the effects of the 2021 car accident that nearly cost him his right leg, had withdrawn. He’d limped through practice rounds early in the week and again during the first and second rounds, but the limp had become more pronounced as the weather worsened. “I am disappointed to have to WD this morning due to reaggravating my plantar fasciitis,” Woods said on Twitter. “Thank you to the fans and to (at)TheMasters who have shown me so much love and support. Good luck to the players today!” The five-time champion finished his second round in cold, driving rain on Saturday to make the cut on the number at 3 over, extending his Masters streak to 23 straight and tying Fred Couples and Gary Player for the longest in history. The 47-year-old Woods headed back out for the start of the third round as temperatures struggled to reach 50 degrees, and it wound up being a water-logged slog. Wearing a gray winter hat over a baseball cap, he started on the 10th hole with a bogey, added another at No. 14, and then had back-to-back double bogeys after finding the water on Nos. 15 and 16. It was the first time Woods has ever had consecutive double bogeys at the Masters. By the time the horn blew ending play with rain still pouring and puddles beginning to stand at Augusta National, Woods was at 9 over and alone in last place among those that made the cut. That was 22 shots behind leader Brooks Koepka . “I’ve always loved this golf course, and I love playing this event,” Woods said after his second round Saturday. “Obviously I’ve missed a couple with some injuries, but I’ve always wanted to play here. I’ve loved it.” Woods also withdrew before the final round of last year’s PGA Championship with what his agent, Mark Steinberg, described as pain and discomfort in his right foot. That came hours after the 15-time major champion limped to a 79 at Southern Hills in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in similarly cold and windy weather; he had shot 69 in the second round. Woods captured his fifth green jacket in 2019 when he finished one shot ahead of Koepka, Dustin Johnson and Xander Schauffele. It was his first major win in 11 years and, at age 43, Woods became the second-oldest player to win the Masters after Jack Nicklaus, who was 46 when he won his sixth green jacket in 1986. Woods was injured in 2021 when his car careened off a suburban Los Angeles road at over 85 mph, crushing his right leg so badly that he said doctors considered amputation. Asked how much hardware held it together, Woods replied: “A lot.” Woods recovered and made the cut at the Masters last year before shooting back-to-back 78s on the weekend. The injuries have forced Woods to play a very limited schedule — the majors and a few select events. He shot two rounds in the 60s and finished tied for 45th at The Genesis Invitational at Riviera in February, but he skipped Bay Hill and The Players Championship so that he would be healthy and ready for a return to Augusta National. The question now is whether Woods will play the PGA Championship at Oak Hill in May. The U.S. Open is at Los Angeles Country Club in June, not far from where Woods grew up, and the British Open is at Royal Liverpool in July. “Yeah, mobility, it’s not where I would like it,” Woods said. “I’ve said to you guys before, I’m very lucky to have this leg — it’s mine. Yes, it has been altered and there’s some hardware in there, but it’s still mine. It has been tough and will always be tough. The ability and endurance of what my leg will do going forward will never be the same. I understand that. “That’s why I can’t prepare and play as many tournaments as I like, but that’s my future, and that’s OK. I’m OK with that.” Associated Press About Contact Help Careers Ad Choices Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Personal Information CA Notice Terms of Service NBC News Sitemap Advertise Select Shopping Select Personal Finance © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL NBC News Logo MSNBC Logo Today Logo\n",

Tiger Woods on the 18th hole during the second round of the Masters golf tournament on Saturday in Augusta, Ga. Charlie Riedel / AP Link copied April 9, 2023, 1:22 PM UTC By Associated Press AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) — Tiger Woods withdrew from the Masters before the resumption of the third round because of an injury Sunday, ending his streak of completing all 72 holes of every tournament he has played at Augusta National as a professional. The tournament announced about 90 minutes before play began that Woods, who is still hobbled by the effects of the 2021 car accident that nearly cost him his right leg, had withdrawn. He’d limped through practice rounds early in the week and again during the first and second rounds, but the limp had become more pronounced as the weather worsened. “I am disappointed to have to WD this morning due to reaggravating my plantar fasciitis,” Woods said on Twitter. “Thank you to the fans and to (at)TheMasters who have shown me so much love and support. Good luck to the players today!” The five-time champion finished his second round in cold, driving rain on Saturday to make the cut on the number at 3 over, extending his Masters streak to 23 straight and tying Fred Couples and Gary Player for the longest in history. The 47-year-old Woods headed back out for the start of the third round as temperatures struggled to reach 50 degrees, and it wound up being a water-logged slog. Wearing a gray winter hat over a baseball cap, he started on the 10th hole with a bogey, added another at No. 14, and then had back-to-back double bogeys after finding the water on Nos. 15 and 16. It was the first time Woods has ever had consecutive double bogeys at the Masters. By the time the horn blew ending play with rain still pouring and puddles beginning to stand at Augusta National, Woods was at 9 over and alone in last place among those that made the cut. That was 22 shots behind leader Brooks Koepka . “I’ve always loved this golf course, and I love playing this event,” Woods said after his second round Saturday. “Obviously I’ve missed a couple with some injuries, but I’ve always wanted to play here. I’ve loved it.” Woods also withdrew before the final round of last year’s PGA Championship with what his agent, Mark Steinberg, described as pain and discomfort in his right foot. That came hours after the 15-time major champion limped to a 79 at Southern Hills in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in similarly cold and windy weather; he had shot 69 in the second round. Woods captured his fifth green jacket in 2019 when he finished one shot ahead of Koepka, Dustin Johnson and Xander Schauffele. It was his first major win in 11 years and, at age 43, Woods became the second-oldest player to win the Masters after Jack Nicklaus, who was 46 when he won his sixth green jacket in 1986. Woods was injured in 2021 when his car careened off a suburban Los Angeles road at over 85 mph, crushing his right leg so badly that he said doctors considered amputation. Asked how much hardware held it together, Woods replied: “A lot.” Woods recovered and made the cut at the Masters last year before shooting back-to-back 78s on the weekend. The injuries have forced Woods to play a very limited schedule — the majors and a few select events. He shot two rounds in the 60s and finished tied for 45th at The Genesis Invitational at Riviera in February, but he skipped Bay Hill and The Players Championship so that he would be healthy and ready for a return to Augusta National. The question now is whether Woods will play the PGA Championship at Oak Hill in May. The U.S. Open is at Los Angeles Country Club in June, not far from where Woods grew up, and the British Open is at Royal Liverpool in July. “Yeah, mobility, it’s not where I would like it,” Woods said. “I’ve said to you guys before, I’m very lucky to have this leg — it’s mine. Yes, it has been altered and there’s some hardware in there, but it’s still mine. It has been tough and will always be tough. The ability and endurance of what my leg will do going forward will never be the same. I understand that. “That’s why I can’t prepare and play as many tournaments as I like, but that’s my future, and that’s OK. I’m OK with that.” Associated Press About Contact Help Careers Ad Choices Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Personal Information CA Notice Terms of Service NBC News Sitemap Advertise Select Shopping Select Personal Finance © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL NBC News Logo MSNBC Logo Today Logo\n",

Godofredo A. Vásquez / AP Link copied April 7, 2023, 5:10 PM UTC By Kalhan Rosenblatt Twitter has put restrictions on how its users interact with posts that contain links to the newsletter platform Substack, just days after Substack announced it would launch a Twitter-like feature called \"Notes.\" When trying on a desktop computer to retweet or like a post with a Substack link, Twitter returned a message: \"Some actions on this Tweet have been disabled by Twitter.\" On the mobile version of Twitter, likes and retweets of posts that shared a Substack link did not work. It also appeared that Twitter had made it so that users could not respond to tweets that included Substack links. Twitter did not immediately return a request for comment. It appeared, however, that tweets with links to Substack newsletters with a unique domain name or shortened links did function normally on Twitter. One user said they were also unable to embed tweets in their Substack. The restriction appeared to have started sometime between Thursday evening and Friday morning. Some Twitter users directed their anger over the change at Twitter CEO Elon Musk. \"Defender of free speech indeed,\" tweeted academic and author Brian Klass. Writer Parker Molloy suggested the move showed that Musk was willing to hurt businesses that use Twitter should he feel slighted by a person or company. Jared Holt, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, tweeted that Musk was disincentivizing Twitter users, rather than Substack users, by limiting their ability to share newsletters from the platform. \"Feel like a broken record on this but Elon Musk fundamentally does not understand the power dynamics of a platform like this,\" he tweeted , adding in a subsequent tweet : \"The value of this website is created by its power users. If you punish them and remove incentives for them to be here, your platform will fail. I haven’t taken a business class in my life and I can identify that much.\" In a statement emailed to NBC News, Substack founders Chris Best, Hamish McKenzie and Jairaj Sethi said they were \"disappointed that Twitter has chosen to restrict writers’ ability to share their work.\" \"Writers deserve the freedom to share links to Substack or anywhere else. This abrupt change is a reminder of why writers deserve a model that puts them in charge, that rewards great work with money, and that protects the free press and free speech,\" the statement read. \"Their livelihoods should not be tied to platforms where they don’t own their relationship with their audience, and where the rules can change on a whim.\" Substack was launched in 2017 and has grown in popularity among writers since. Twitter became a destination for those with Substack newsletters to share their work and accrue new subscribers. Although some Substacks are free, others charge subscribers a fee in order to access their newsletter. Substack's newly announced \"Notes\" feature is similar to Twitter both in appearance and functionality. Users can \"restack\" a post, which shares that post in the same way as a \"retweet,\" in addition to liking and commenting on it. Security researcher Jane Manchun Wong questioned why Twitter was responding so harshly to Substack’s \"Notes\" feature. \"I don’t get why Twitter is having such a strong reaction over Substack’s Twitter lookalike,\" she tweeted . \"People signed up on Mastodon a while back but are still sticking around here. The community on Substack Notes will be more niche in comparison. I wouldn’t be too worried.\" Kalhan Rosenblatt Kalhan Rosenblatt is a reporter covering youth and internet culture for NBC News, based in New York.

A Red Cross shirt featuring Snoopy is driving blood donations. American Red Cross Link copied April 7, 2023, 10:12 PM UTC By Brahmjot Kaur The American Red Cross partnered with the popular Peanuts cartoon brand to create an exclusive T-shirt featuring Snoopy for people donating blood. Now, the shirt is going viral on TikTok and first-time blood donors are showing up to get their hands on the exclusive merch. The collaboration has increased traffic and the number of appointments being made for blood donations, according to the Red Cross. It’s found an audience on TikTok, with users documenting their visit and their new shirt, which features Snoopy’s alter ego, Joe Cool, and the phrase “Be Cool. Give Blood.” Cathy Chang, who goes by @uh…o_o on TikTok, posted a 6-second video Wednesday about her shirt that garnered over 4 million views. She said she saw a video about the collaboration, which runs from April 1-23, from another user and decided to donate blood for the first time because of the shirt. “If I see something cute and I don’t have to pay for it, I’m gonna go do whatever I need to do to get it,” she said. Commenters on her video shared their feelings about the hype around the collaboration. “They’re finally realizing we will do anything for merch,” one person commented. “i literally skipped class to go donate blood to get my shirt,” another person wrote. Chang, 24, said she wanted to donate blood in the past but had a fear of fainting. This T-shirt, however, was enough for her to confront that fear. Darren Irby, the executive director of national brand partnerships at the Red Cross, said it’s been fascinating to see this collaboration’s momentum. “It’s been really great to see so many young folks so fired up by this particular partnership and realizing that maybe their fear of needles or other concerns aren’t as bad as what they thought they might be,” he said. Irby said some of that success could already be seen in their data. “We’ve seen web traffic to our appointment page — since Monday, it is up 50% versus our six-month running averages,” he explained. “What’s really cool and speaks to the social aspect of this is that organic search is up 600% over the last couple of days.” The Red Cross has done similar projects for “Game of Thrones” and “Wonder Woman 1984,” but Irby says that Peanuts fans are more multigenerational than fans of some other brands, which likely helped with the collaboration's reach. “Several years ago, we made the conscious decision to inspire new donors through the lens of their existing interests and their own passion points,” he said. “We do this a few times a year, and it’s really made a difference. So, we strategically reached out to Peanuts because we loved the cross-generational appeal that [it] offered.” Irby said young people are often introduced to blood drives through their high schools, but the pandemic made drives less and less accessible. Social media has helped bridge some of that gap. Chang said she’s grateful her video went viral and helped spread the new promotion. “I’m glad that this TikTok got a lot of attention because a lot of times, no one will go out of their way to search out where they can donate blood, but then they see this incentive on social media,” she said.

Godofredo A. Vásquez / AP Link copied April 7, 2023, 5:10 PM UTC By Kalhan Rosenblatt Twitter has put restrictions on how its users interact with posts that contain links to the newsletter platform Substack, just days after Substack announced it would launch a Twitter-like feature called \"Notes.\" When trying on a desktop computer to retweet or like a post with a Substack link, Twitter returned a message: \"Some actions on this Tweet have been disabled by Twitter.\" On the mobile version of Twitter, likes and retweets of posts that shared a Substack link did not work. It also appeared that Twitter had made it so that users could not respond to tweets that included Substack links. Twitter did not immediately return a request for comment. It appeared, however, that tweets with links to Substack newsletters with a unique domain name or shortened links did function normally on Twitter. One user said they were also unable to embed tweets in their Substack. The restriction appeared to have started sometime between Thursday evening and Friday morning. Some Twitter users directed their anger over the change at Twitter CEO Elon Musk. \"Defender of free speech indeed,\" tweeted academic and author Brian Klass. Writer Parker Molloy suggested the move showed that Musk was willing to hurt businesses that use Twitter should he feel slighted by a person or company. Jared Holt, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, tweeted that Musk was disincentivizing Twitter users, rather than Substack users, by limiting their ability to share newsletters from the platform. \"Feel like a broken record on this but Elon Musk fundamentally does not understand the power dynamics of a platform like this,\" he tweeted , adding in a subsequent tweet : \"The value of this website is created by its power users. If you punish them and remove incentives for them to be here, your platform will fail. I haven’t taken a business class in my life and I can identify that much.\" In a statement emailed to NBC News, Substack founders Chris Best, Hamish McKenzie and Jairaj Sethi said they were \"disappointed that Twitter has chosen to restrict writers’ ability to share their work.\" \"Writers deserve the freedom to share links to Substack or anywhere else. This abrupt change is a reminder of why writers deserve a model that puts them in charge, that rewards great work with money, and that protects the free press and free speech,\" the statement read. \"Their livelihoods should not be tied to platforms where they don’t own their relationship with their audience, and where the rules can change on a whim.\" Substack was launched in 2017 and has grown in popularity among writers since. Twitter became a destination for those with Substack newsletters to share their work and accrue new subscribers. Although some Substacks are free, others charge subscribers a fee in order to access their newsletter. Substack's newly announced \"Notes\" feature is similar to Twitter both in appearance and functionality. Users can \"restack\" a post, which shares that post in the same way as a \"retweet,\" in addition to liking and commenting on it. Security researcher Jane Manchun Wong questioned why Twitter was responding so harshly to Substack’s \"Notes\" feature. \"I don’t get why Twitter is having such a strong reaction over Substack’s Twitter lookalike,\" she tweeted . \"People signed up on Mastodon a while back but are still sticking around here. The community on Substack Notes will be more niche in comparison. I wouldn’t be too worried.\" Kalhan Rosenblatt Kalhan Rosenblatt is a reporter covering youth and internet culture for NBC News, based in New York.

A Red Cross shirt featuring Snoopy is driving blood donations. American Red Cross Link copied April 7, 2023, 10:12 PM UTC By Brahmjot Kaur The American Red Cross partnered with the popular Peanuts cartoon brand to create an exclusive T-shirt featuring Snoopy for people donating blood. Now, the shirt is going viral on TikTok and first-time blood donors are showing up to get their hands on the exclusive merch. The collaboration has increased traffic and the number of appointments being made for blood donations, according to the Red Cross. It’s found an audience on TikTok, with users documenting their visit and their new shirt, which features Snoopy’s alter ego, Joe Cool, and the phrase “Be Cool. Give Blood.” Cathy Chang, who goes by @uh…o_o on TikTok, posted a 6-second video Wednesday about her shirt that garnered over 4 million views. She said she saw a video about the collaboration, which runs from April 1-23, from another user and decided to donate blood for the first time because of the shirt. “If I see something cute and I don’t have to pay for it, I’m gonna go do whatever I need to do to get it,” she said. Commenters on her video shared their feelings about the hype around the collaboration. “They’re finally realizing we will do anything for merch,” one person commented. “i literally skipped class to go donate blood to get my shirt,” another person wrote. Chang, 24, said she wanted to donate blood in the past but had a fear of fainting. This T-shirt, however, was enough for her to confront that fear. Darren Irby, the executive director of national brand partnerships at the Red Cross, said it’s been fascinating to see this collaboration’s momentum. “It’s been really great to see so many young folks so fired up by this particular partnership and realizing that maybe their fear of needles or other concerns aren’t as bad as what they thought they might be,” he said. Irby said some of that success could already be seen in their data. “We’ve seen web traffic to our appointment page — since Monday, it is up 50% versus our six-month running averages,” he explained. “What’s really cool and speaks to the social aspect of this is that organic search is up 600% over the last couple of days.” The Red Cross has done similar projects for “Game of Thrones” and “Wonder Woman 1984,” but Irby says that Peanuts fans are more multigenerational than fans of some other brands, which likely helped with the collaboration's reach. “Several years ago, we made the conscious decision to inspire new donors through the lens of their existing interests and their own passion points,” he said. “We do this a few times a year, and it’s really made a difference. So, we strategically reached out to Peanuts because we loved the cross-generational appeal that [it] offered.” Irby said young people are often introduced to blood drives through their high schools, but the pandemic made drives less and less accessible. Social media has helped bridge some of that gap. Chang said she’s grateful her video went viral and helped spread the new promotion. “I’m glad that this TikTok got a lot of attention because a lot of times, no one will go out of their way to search out where they can donate blood, but then they see this incentive on social media,” she said.

Climate change is leading to more home runs, says new study 04:04 Link copied April 7, 2023, 12:00 PM UTC By David K. Li The explosion of home runs in Major League Baseball can be traced, in small part, to climate change, according to a study published Friday. In a peer-reviewed paper published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society , Dartmouth College researchers said they can connect at least 500 additional home runs from 2010 to 2019 to Earth's human-made warming. The research was based on their simple premise that \"air density is inversely proportional to temperature,\" according to the paper, and that with all \"else being equal, warmer air is less dense and a batted ball will carry farther.\" \"In some ways this wasn't all that surprising,\" said Dartmouth doctoral student Christopher Callahan, who authored the paper with Nathaniel Dominy, a professor of anthropology; Jeremy DeSilva, the chair of the anthropology department; and Justin Mankin, an assistant professor who studies climate variability and the risks posed by global warming. “It was relatively straightforward. In some ways it was confirming that basic physical understanding that we already had.\" From 1998, the first season of the 30-team MLB, through last year —and not including Covid-shortened 2020 — the number of home runs has varied annually from 4,186 in 2014 to 6,776 in 2019 . If current climate trends continue, researchers said, there will be 192 additional long balls per year by 2050 and 467 more per season by 2100, researchers said. Home runs have been surging in MLB for decades with big league analytics operations pushing batters to swing for the fences as the most efficient manner to score, as opposed to more old-fashioned small-ball methods, such as hitting singles or stealing bases. And Callahan was quick to point out that his team's research accounts for only a small part of the homer-happy trend. \"Certainly the analytics revolution has played a major role,\" Callahan said. \"We say that climate change has caused about 500 more home runs over the past 10 years [2010-19] but that's only about 1 percent of home runs. There's 5,000 a year, so we're only saying 50 per year. Those other factors are definitely more responsible as of now than global warming,\" he added. From the start of pro baseball in the late 19th century through 1993 , there was only one season when the average team hit more than 1 home run per game. But starting in 1994, the average has topped 1 in all but four seasons. The top four homer seasons have all been recorded since 2017 — 1.39 in 2019, 1.28 in 2020, 1.26 in 2017 and 1.22 in 2021. Opening Day 2023: Inside the new rules for MLB March 30, 2023 03:40 In baseball lore, the 1927 New York Yankees are often regarded as the game's greatest team, boasting all-time greats Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig . The 110-win \" Murderers Row \" team hit 158 homers in 155 games, an awe-inspiring total for the day but below average by 21st century standards. So far in this very young 2023 season, there have been 1.19 long balls per game. Perhaps not coincidentally, the average high temperature in the U.S. has also been steadily ticking up . Homer hotbeds of the future will be in outdoor stadiums with more day games, as opposed to parks that are domed — and thus temperature-controlled — and host more night games, according to the Dartmouth research. Kyle Tucker of the Houston Astros hits a home run Wednesday against the Detroit Tigers in Houston. Bob Levey / Getty Images The ballparks that will have more climate-affected home runs will be Chicago’s Wrigley Field, Detroit’s Comerica Park, Minnesota’s Target Field and Denver’s Coors Field, researchers said. And on the other end of the spectrum, venues that won’t feel the heat of climate homers will be St. Petersburg’s Tropicana Field, Miami’s LoanDepot Park, Houston’s Minute Maid Park and Phoenix’s Chase Field, which are all indoor facilities. “One thing that I was surprised by was the amount of variations going forward. Places like Wrigley Field will see a lot more home runs in the future, because it’s open air and a lot of games are played in the daytime,” said Callahan, a Chicago native who grew up blocks away from Wrigley. “And so you get a ton of more [climate-affected] home runs there, but you’ll get a lot fewer in places where there are domes and the games are more frequently played in the evening to start with. So you can get a lot of variation in different parks over time, and that’s something that surprised me.” Gerald Meehl, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, said he, too, sees connections the Dartmouth study made between climate and home runs. “It’s an interesting application of climate change attribution and gets at a very baseball concept of shifting the odds towards a better chance of hitting home runs,” Meehl said. Speaking as an avid baseball fan and less as a scientist, Callahan said he’s mostly afraid of global warming’s impact on humankind — but also mildly miffed about its influence on America’s pastime. “I am a little bit disinterested in a game of baseball that’s all about home runs,” Callahan said. “I do like a little more action on the field. If it is the case that global warming will provide an extra incentive to just focus on home runs, I personally would not be super happy about that.” David K. Li David K.

Climate change is leading to more home runs, says new study 04:04 Link copied April 7, 2023, 12:00 PM UTC By David K. Li The explosion of home runs in Major League Baseball can be traced, in small part, to climate change, according to a study published Friday. In a peer-reviewed paper published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society , Dartmouth College researchers said they can connect at least 500 additional home runs from 2010 to 2019 to Earth's human-made warming. The research was based on their simple premise that \"air density is inversely proportional to temperature,\" according to the paper, and that with all \"else being equal, warmer air is less dense and a batted ball will carry farther.\" \"In some ways this wasn't all that surprising,\" said Dartmouth doctoral student Christopher Callahan, who authored the paper with Nathaniel Dominy, a professor of anthropology; Jeremy DeSilva, the chair of the anthropology department; and Justin Mankin, an assistant professor who studies climate variability and the risks posed by global warming. “It was relatively straightforward. In some ways it was confirming that basic physical understanding that we already had.\" From 1998, the first season of the 30-team MLB, through last year —and not including Covid-shortened 2020 — the number of home runs has varied annually from 4,186 in 2014 to 6,776 in 2019 . If current climate trends continue, researchers said, there will be 192 additional long balls per year by 2050 and 467 more per season by 2100, researchers said. Home runs have been surging in MLB for decades with big league analytics operations pushing batters to swing for the fences as the most efficient manner to score, as opposed to more old-fashioned small-ball methods, such as hitting singles or stealing bases. And Callahan was quick to point out that his team's research accounts for only a small part of the homer-happy trend. \"Certainly the analytics revolution has played a major role,\" Callahan said. \"We say that climate change has caused about 500 more home runs over the past 10 years [2010-19] but that's only about 1 percent of home runs. There's 5,000 a year, so we're only saying 50 per year. Those other factors are definitely more responsible as of now than global warming,\" he added. From the start of pro baseball in the late 19th century through 1993 , there was only one season when the average team hit more than 1 home run per game. But starting in 1994, the average has topped 1 in all but four seasons. The top four homer seasons have all been recorded since 2017 — 1.39 in 2019, 1.28 in 2020, 1.26 in 2017 and 1.22 in 2021. Opening Day 2023: Inside the new rules for MLB March 30, 2023 03:40 In baseball lore, the 1927 New York Yankees are often regarded as the game's greatest team, boasting all-time greats Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig . The 110-win \" Murderers Row \" team hit 158 homers in 155 games, an awe-inspiring total for the day but below average by 21st century standards. So far in this very young 2023 season, there have been 1.19 long balls per game. Perhaps not coincidentally, the average high temperature in the U.S. has also been steadily ticking up . Homer hotbeds of the future will be in outdoor stadiums with more day games, as opposed to parks that are domed — and thus temperature-controlled — and host more night games, according to the Dartmouth research. Kyle Tucker of the Houston Astros hits a home run Wednesday against the Detroit Tigers in Houston. Bob Levey / Getty Images The ballparks that will have more climate-affected home runs will be Chicago’s Wrigley Field, Detroit’s Comerica Park, Minnesota’s Target Field and Denver’s Coors Field, researchers said. And on the other end of the spectrum, venues that won’t feel the heat of climate homers will be St. Petersburg’s Tropicana Field, Miami’s LoanDepot Park, Houston’s Minute Maid Park and Phoenix’s Chase Field, which are all indoor facilities. “One thing that I was surprised by was the amount of variations going forward. Places like Wrigley Field will see a lot more home runs in the future, because it’s open air and a lot of games are played in the daytime,” said Callahan, a Chicago native who grew up blocks away from Wrigley. “And so you get a ton of more [climate-affected] home runs there, but you’ll get a lot fewer in places where there are domes and the games are more frequently played in the evening to start with. So you can get a lot of variation in different parks over time, and that’s something that surprised me.” Gerald Meehl, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, said he, too, sees connections the Dartmouth study made between climate and home runs. “It’s an interesting application of climate change attribution and gets at a very baseball concept of shifting the odds towards a better chance of hitting home runs,” Meehl said. Speaking as an avid baseball fan and less as a scientist, Callahan said he’s mostly afraid of global warming’s impact on humankind — but also mildly miffed about its influence on America’s pastime. “I am a little bit disinterested in a game of baseball that’s all about home runs,” Callahan said. “I do like a little more action on the field. If it is the case that global warming will provide an extra incentive to just focus on home runs, I personally would not be super happy about that.” David K. Li David K.

There have been at least 478 tornado reports this year across 25 states as of Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service. Only 2017, with 503 tornado reports, and 2008, with 523, had more at this point in the year. Pinning down how tornado activity will change in a warming world — if at all — is an active area of research, and more data is needed. But a picture is emerging of how risks are changing across parts of the country, particularly in areas where social factors compound vulnerabilities to extreme weather. This year’s active start can be blamed, at least in part, on the mild winter conditions experienced across much of the country , said Harold Brooks, a senior research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Severe Storms Laboratory. Warmer-than-usual winters create the type of atmospheric instability in early spring that is a key ingredient for severe storms, including those that spin up tornadoes. “If you don’t get the cold fronts across the Gulf, all you need is a little bit of wind to bring in a lot of warm, moist air,” Brooks said. “And this has been a year where cold fronts really haven’t gotten that far south. The southern part of the U.S. was not particularly cold this winter.” This dynamic is why tornadoes in the South occur more commonly in the cooler months, from late fall through winter and into early spring. It’s also why this part of the country may become more vulnerable as the world warms. A study published last week in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society found that supercell storms, which can produce violent tornadoes, will increase as the world warms . These storms are also projected to hit Southern states like Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee more frequently in the future, according to the research. That shift could have enormous implications, because the South is more densely populated than other parts of the country where tornadoes often strike, said Walker Ashley, an atmospheric scientist at Northern Illinois University and lead author of the recent study on supercell storms. As such, a tornado that touches down in the South is more likely to hit where people live compared to if that same tornado struck somewhere in the Great Plains. “The underlying social landscape of a place like Mississippi compared to, say, Kansas is the primary driver in the difference in impact,” Ashley said. “There’s a lot of people spread out across the landscape in the South, so the odds of somebody being impacted is far greater in Mississippi or Alabama or Arkansas or Tennessee.” These risks are further heightened by existing socioeconomic issues and the prevalence of mobile homes and manufactured housing across the Southeast. On average, 54% of tornado-related fatalities are in mobile homes, according to the weather service . People who seek shelter in mobile homes are also 15 to 20 times more likely to be killed compared to those who take refuge in permanent homes. A man surveys the debris outside his destroyed home Wednesday in Glenallen, Mo. Michael B. Thomas / Getty Images Those grim statistics came into sharp focus last week after a violent tornado ripped through Rolling Fork, Mississippi, causing widespread destruction in a predominantly Black community where roughly 21% of the residents in poverty. The county’s coroner said eight of the town’s 13 deaths involved people in mobile homes. So far this year, more than 60 deaths have been linked to tornadoes.  The yearly average for tornado-related deaths in the United States is 71. While the season is off to an active start, there's no indication that the pace of severe storms will continue in the months ahead, said Jason Naylor, an associate professor of atmospheric science at the University of Louisville. “In 2011, we had the busiest tornado year in the last 20-plus years, but at this point, we only had around 240,” he said. “It was looking to be anomalously low, but then a few weeks later, at the end of April, we had a super-outbreak that hit the Southeast, and that ended up being the most tornadoes in a 24-hour period.” Still, the flurry of tornado activity in recent weeks highlights the need to raise awareness about the risks. This is particularly important in parts of the country where tornadoes are expected to strike more frequently in the future, according to Ashley. “I don’t think I would say it’s a new normal,” he said, “but the problem is the normal is always changing.” Denise Chow Denise Chow is a reporter for NBC News Science focused on general science and climate change.

Alexander Shaw of T&C Movers loads garbage into a U-Haul truck Wednesday in Jackson, Miss. Hannah Mattix / Clarion Ledger / USA Today Network Link copied April 6, 2023, 6:03 PM UTC By Bracey Harris and Deon J. Hampton JACKSON, Miss. — Residents of Mississippi’s capital are scrambling to figure out what to do with their trash after garbage collection abruptly ended this week as contract negotiations failed between the mayor and the City Council. Stacks of cardboard boxes and black plastic garbage bags lined residential streets or were dumped in the front yards of vacant homes throughout the city, angering residents who called for a quick resolution before the dispute escalates into a public health crisis. The sudden end to trash-hauling services in Jackson is the latest problem to plague the state’s largest city, which is already roiled by gun violence , unpredictable access to clean drinking water and crumbling, pothole-riddled streets. More than a quarter of residents in the state’s predominantly Black capital live in poverty. Many Jacksonians rely on public transportation, or a neighbor’s goodwill for rides, which makes it difficult to bring their trash to a dropoff point. “This is absolutely ridiculous. We have all of the problems with crime, potholes, dilapidated buildings, and we are putting our effort and energy into garbage,” said Tim Norris, who is considering moving his restaurant, Mom’s Dream Kitchen, out of town. “At the end of the day, it’s poor leadership.” Boiling Point: Jackson’s decadeslong fight for clean water Dec. 15, 2022 20:53 The contract dispute, which has been brewing for two years, came to a head recently when Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and some City Council members could not come to an agreement over which company should be allowed to pick up the city’s trash. As a result, in a split 3-3 vote, with one member abstaining, the council failed to ratify a proposal last weekend to award Richard’s Disposal, a New Orleans-based company that has been collecting trash for the past year, a new, six-year $54 million contract. Richard's Disposal employees load up a truck in Jackson on Oct. 7. Rogelio V. Solis / AP file “This is about the ability to execute in a professional manner,” said City Council President Ashby Foote, who voted against the contract Saturday, saying that although Richard’s Disposal submitted the lowest bid, its ratings on an evaluation conducted by the city were not up to par. Jackson City Councilman Brian Grizzell contends Richard’s won the contract bid fairly. “Richard’s Disposal should get the contract,” Grizzell said. “This council has yet to give bonafide reasons to not award that contract.” The mayor’s office declined to comment this week, but Lumumba acknowledged after Saturday’s vote that he was running out of options. “The council has to approve the contract,” he said in a statement. “As mayor, I can only present the contract.” He said at a news conference Thursday that he had called an emergency meeting of the council for Monday. Richard’s Disposal did not respond to phone calls seeking comment. City officials are waiting to learn whether a specially appointed judge will allow the City Council to bypass the process in which Lumumba has to bring a contract forward for a vote. If so, the council could award a contract independently of the mayor, which could take months if the council has to reopen the bid process. Uncollected garbage in Jackson on Monday. Barbara Gauntt / Clarion Ledger / USA Today Network As the bickering wears on, Jackson residents and business owners are left figuring out what to do with their trash. “We’re having to deal with the consequences,” said Felicia McClinton, president of the Gowdy Washington Addition Neighborhood Association. “It has caused a lot of frustration.” Some residents have been dropping off their garbage at gas stations, school dumpsters and neighboring towns, said Jackson resident Lavette Mack. “This can’t go on any longer,” she said. Others have opted to pay companies to pick up their refuse; some business owners have begun offering trash pickup to residents for as little as $15 a week. At least one business offered to pick up trash for elderly residents for free. The city set up a makeshift dropoff site in the parking lot of the once-thriving Metrocenter Mall, but it’s difficult for residents without a car to access it. As with the city’s water crisis, which at its peak last summer left residents without running water for a week, this latest breakdown in public services has the potential to hit Jackson’s most vulnerable residents the hardest. Last year, Maisie Brown, a senior at Jackson State University, spent weeks coordinating bottled water efforts for residents who couldn’t travel to water distribution sites. While the crisis has eased, people are still seeking help and the city continues to issue boil-water advisories for particular streets. “It’s like, ‘OK, the water situation has slowed down,’” said Brown, a member of the Mississippi Student Advocacy Team, a group of Jackson-area students that has fundraised for disaster relief. “Now, we’re in a situation where the trash is piling up and no one’s coming to get it.” Between the trash issues and last year’s water outage that left many residents unable to shower or flush toilets, she questioned whether people would invest in the city given all that’s taken place — and whether her classmates, particularly those from out of state, would choose to stay after graduation. Jackson has also struggled recently with violent crime. The city of about 150,000 people experienced a record 153 homicides in 2021, one of the highest homicide rates in the country. “It’s a frown on the city. So many issues are being addressed in the public eye,” McClinton said. “We have a lot of issues. It does not look good.” Geno Lee, owner of the Big Apple Inn restaurant, said he has always paid for private trash service at his establishment, but this week he had to dole out an extra $600 in emergency trash removal fees because  residents have been dumping their refuse in his bins. In South Jackson, members of the violence interruption organization Operation Good were racing Thursday to beat bad weather, as they picked up trash bags in the community. The group organized for a dumpster to be placed on McDowell Road, where they’ll drop off their hauls. It’s badly needed. Tim Finch, outreach manager for Operation Good, said critters were already tearing into garbage bags that had been set out. Volunteers picked up the strewn trash, re-bagged it and sprayed liners with bleach in hopes of warding the animals off. “This is a straight gut blow” he said. Finch said that in previous water crises, South Jackson was the last to see pressure restored. He worries that the community will be left behind in this dispute, too. Even before the contract breakdown, the group assisted residents who were physically incapable of carrying their garbage farther than their carport. He worries the smell from waste piling up could irritate children with asthma. Finch’s group, however, is used to banding together when basic government services falter. “We’re going to haul until we can’t haul any more,” he said. Bracey Harris reported from Jackson and Deon J.

Alexander Shaw of T&C Movers loads garbage into a U-Haul truck Wednesday in Jackson, Miss. Hannah Mattix / Clarion Ledger / USA Today Network Link copied April 6, 2023, 6:03 PM UTC By Bracey Harris and Deon J. Hampton JACKSON, Miss. — Residents of Mississippi’s capital are scrambling to figure out what to do with their trash after garbage collection abruptly ended this week as contract negotiations failed between the mayor and the City Council. Stacks of cardboard boxes and black plastic garbage bags lined residential streets or were dumped in the front yards of vacant homes throughout the city, angering residents who called for a quick resolution before the dispute escalates into a public health crisis. The sudden end to trash-hauling services in Jackson is the latest problem to plague the state’s largest city, which is already roiled by gun violence , unpredictable access to clean drinking water and crumbling, pothole-riddled streets. More than a quarter of residents in the state’s predominantly Black capital live in poverty. Many Jacksonians rely on public transportation, or a neighbor’s goodwill for rides, which makes it difficult to bring their trash to a dropoff point. “This is absolutely ridiculous. We have all of the problems with crime, potholes, dilapidated buildings, and we are putting our effort and energy into garbage,” said Tim Norris, who is considering moving his restaurant, Mom’s Dream Kitchen, out of town. “At the end of the day, it’s poor leadership.” Boiling Point: Jackson’s decadeslong fight for clean water Dec. 15, 2022 20:53 The contract dispute, which has been brewing for two years, came to a head recently when Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and some City Council members could not come to an agreement over which company should be allowed to pick up the city’s trash. As a result, in a split 3-3 vote, with one member abstaining, the council failed to ratify a proposal last weekend to award Richard’s Disposal, a New Orleans-based company that has been collecting trash for the past year, a new, six-year $54 million contract. Richard's Disposal employees load up a truck in Jackson on Oct. 7. Rogelio V. Solis / AP file “This is about the ability to execute in a professional manner,” said City Council President Ashby Foote, who voted against the contract Saturday, saying that although Richard’s Disposal submitted the lowest bid, its ratings on an evaluation conducted by the city were not up to par. Jackson City Councilman Brian Grizzell contends Richard’s won the contract bid fairly. “Richard’s Disposal should get the contract,” Grizzell said. “This council has yet to give bonafide reasons to not award that contract.” The mayor’s office declined to comment this week, but Lumumba acknowledged after Saturday’s vote that he was running out of options. “The council has to approve the contract,” he said in a statement. “As mayor, I can only present the contract.” He said at a news conference Thursday that he had called an emergency meeting of the council for Monday. Richard’s Disposal did not respond to phone calls seeking comment. City officials are waiting to learn whether a specially appointed judge will allow the City Council to bypass the process in which Lumumba has to bring a contract forward for a vote. If so, the council could award a contract independently of the mayor, which could take months if the council has to reopen the bid process. Uncollected garbage in Jackson on Monday. Barbara Gauntt / Clarion Ledger / USA Today Network As the bickering wears on, Jackson residents and business owners are left figuring out what to do with their trash. “We’re having to deal with the consequences,” said Felicia McClinton, president of the Gowdy Washington Addition Neighborhood Association. “It has caused a lot of frustration.” Some residents have been dropping off their garbage at gas stations, school dumpsters and neighboring towns, said Jackson resident Lavette Mack. “This can’t go on any longer,” she said. Others have opted to pay companies to pick up their refuse; some business owners have begun offering trash pickup to residents for as little as $15 a week. At least one business offered to pick up trash for elderly residents for free. The city set up a makeshift dropoff site in the parking lot of the once-thriving Metrocenter Mall, but it’s difficult for residents without a car to access it. As with the city’s water crisis, which at its peak last summer left residents without running water for a week, this latest breakdown in public services has the potential to hit Jackson’s most vulnerable residents the hardest. Last year, Maisie Brown, a senior at Jackson State University, spent weeks coordinating bottled water efforts for residents who couldn’t travel to water distribution sites. While the crisis has eased, people are still seeking help and the city continues to issue boil-water advisories for particular streets. “It’s like, ‘OK, the water situation has slowed down,’” said Brown, a member of the Mississippi Student Advocacy Team, a group of Jackson-area students that has fundraised for disaster relief. “Now, we’re in a situation where the trash is piling up and no one’s coming to get it.” Between the trash issues and last year’s water outage that left many residents unable to shower or flush toilets, she questioned whether people would invest in the city given all that’s taken place — and whether her classmates, particularly those from out of state, would choose to stay after graduation. Jackson has also struggled recently with violent crime. The city of about 150,000 people experienced a record 153 homicides in 2021, one of the highest homicide rates in the country. “It’s a frown on the city. So many issues are being addressed in the public eye,” McClinton said. “We have a lot of issues. It does not look good.” Geno Lee, owner of the Big Apple Inn restaurant, said he has always paid for private trash service at his establishment, but this week he had to dole out an extra $600 in emergency trash removal fees because  residents have been dumping their refuse in his bins.

Experts say Russians are stealing art from Ukrainian museums 02:02 Link copied April 6, 2023, 10:30 AM UTC By Yasmine Salam and Dan De Luce Last fall, Ukrainian troops were closing in on Kherson, rolling back Russian forces who had seized the city after Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine. At the Kherson Regional Art Museum, a team of armed Russians in civilian clothes arrived along with several large trucks and buses. Over five days, they hauled away more than 11,000 pieces of art, including paintings, sculptures, graphics and other works from Ukraine and around the world, said Alina Dotsenko, the director of the museum.

Dimitar Dilkoff / AFP via Getty Images file “It was obvious that it was all planned. The decision to loot the museum was not made on the spot,” Dotsenko said. “It was all carefully planned.” The theft, verified by human rights monitors and independent scholars, was not an isolated incident. A growing body of evidence suggests Russian forces are systematically stealing art and cultural artifacts from Ukraine on a scale not seen in Europe since the Nazi plunder of World War II, according to researchers and experts documenting the damage. The theft includes precious Scythian gold jewelry dating to the fourth century B.C., ancient coins and thousands of paintings from museums and private collections, researchers said. Some art and cultural sites have been severely damaged and destroyed, including centuries-old Orthodox Christian churches, libraries and paintings by one of Ukraine’s most beloved artists, Maria Prymachenko, whose work was hailed by Pablo Picasso as an “artistic miracle.” Russians in plainclothes load stolen artwork from the Kherson Regional Art Museum into the back of a truck in November. Courtesy Kherson Regional Art Museum The organized campaign of looting and destruction, targeting hundreds of cultural monuments, churches and museums, appears aimed at wiping out Ukraine’s history and cultural identity, experts said. Before he ordered the Feb. 24, 2022, invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin repeatedly argued that the idea of a separate Ukrainian national identity was fiction, that Ukraine lacked “real statehood” and that it was part of Russia’s “own history, culture, spiritual space.” “They are trying to erase Ukrainian identity, just the way the Nazis did,” said Chris Marinello, an art restitution lawyer and the founder of a stolen and looted art recovery firm. Ancient Scythian gold jewelry was among the artifacts Russian forces stole in Ukraine, researchers and museum staff members say. A. Dagli Orti / De Agostini via Getty Images file Putin’s “forces have bombed, shelled and destroyed hundreds of sites and places that epitomize Ukrainian identity and heritage — from churches and museums to archaeological sites and monuments,” said Richard Kurin, the ambassador-at-large of the Smithsonian Institution. “He seeks to eliminate the physical markers of Ukraine’s distinctive culture so as to conform to his warped view that there is no such culture.” The Russian Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. In some cases, museums or other cultural sites have been targeted far away from any front line, according to satellite imagery and researchers on the ground. Just days after the Feb. 24 invasion, the Ivankiv Historical and Local History Museum near Kyiv came under bombardment, even though it was not near any fighting or military targets, according to researchers. The shelling ignited a fire that destroyed and damaged multiple works by Prymachenko, whose vivid, fantastical paintings of animals inspired painter Marc Chagall. Satellite imagery shows the Ivankiv Historical and Local History Museum on Feb. 14, 2022, left, before the invasion, and after it was damaged by Russian shelling on Feb. 27. Maxar The attack on the Ivankiv museum is part of a pattern of “targeted destruction” of cultural sites, said Katharyn Hanson, the head of research at the Smithsonian Cultural Rescue Initiative. The theft of priceless art in areas seized by Russian forces cannot be explained as random or spontaneous acts by Russian soldiers, Hanson said. “Our research suggests that this looting is state-sponsored by Russia,” Hanson said. Hanson is one of the authors of a report due to be released this month by the Smithsonian Cultural Rescue Initiative examining the plunder of cultural heritage in Ukraine since the Russian invasion. In a modern version of the World War II-era effort to save artistic treasures from German looting depicted in the Hollywood film “Monuments Men,” Hanson is part of a team of archaeologists, historians, satellite imagery experts and other scholars trying to document the assault on Ukraine’s cultural sites. Using satellite photos, thermal imaging, artificial intelligence tools and on-the-ground research, the U.S.-funded Smithsonian team is sometimes able to verify an incident within hours after it occurs, said Susan Wolfinbarger, the team lead in the State Department’s Office of Advanced Analytics . “We’re really leveraging new technologies, new data feeds, to help us both document these things but to also do it quickly and at a scale that really hasn’t been previously attempted,” Wolfinbarger said. Using a database of more than 28,000 cultural sites in Ukraine, the Smithsonian team was able to spot an attack on the museum in Ivankiv from a combination of thermal imaging from NASA and commercial satellite photos, she said. The Smithsonian initiative is part of a wider $6 million effort funded by the Biden administration — involving a variety of American research centers — to collect evidence for possible international war crimes investigations. Russian forces targeted cultural monuments earlier in the conflict, after having seized the Crimean Peninsula and parts of eastern Ukraine more than eight years ago, said Matthew Steinhelfer, the deputy assistant secretary for the State Department’s Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations. Russian forces left behind empty picture frames after they hauled away paintings from the Kherson Regional Art Museum. Kherson Regional Art Museum “We’ve seen this playbook before,” he said. “We’ve seen this since 2014, where Russia has removed artifacts, demolished gravesites and shuttered churches in the Donbas region and Crimea.” The Hague Convention of 1954 prohibits militaries from targeting and looting museums or other cultural sites. In war crimes trials for conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and Mali, international prosecutors won convictions that cited attacks on religious and cultural monuments. As of March, UNESCO said it had verified damage to 248 cultural sites in Ukraine, including 107 religious sites and 12 libraries. “We have this list of verified damage, and the numbers keep growing,” said Krista Pikkat, UNESCO’s director for culture and emergencies. The World Bank recently estimated that the cost of the damage so far to Ukraine’s cultural buildings and art collections from the invasion amounts to nearly $2 billion. International cultural organizations and Interpol are warning authorities across Europe and around the world to be on the lookout for art stolen from Ukraine. The International Council of Museums has issued an “emergency red list” of artworks at risk, which UNESCO now uses to train border officials in other countries, U.N. officials said. Works by Ukrainian artist Maria Prymachenko that were rescued from Ivankiv on display in Lviv on Aug. 23. Jeff J. Mitchell / Getty Images file Last year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials seized three ancient swords dating to the fifth or sixth century, as well as an ancient stone ax head, at New York’s JFK Airport, all stolen from Ukraine. They were returned to the government in a ceremony last month at Ukraine’s embassy in Washington. When Ukrainian art and artifacts have been looted, Russian troops are often helped by Russian experts who travel to seized territory and know the country’s art collections, say experts in and outside Ukraine. “There are expert groups who were specially commissioned to come to Ukraine,” said Ihor Poshyvailo, a Ukrainian curator who was trained by the Smithsonian team before the invasion. “They were hunting for historic objects,” said Poshyvailo, a co-founder of the Heritage Emergency Response Initiative, which tries to help repair and preserve Ukraine’s cultural heritage collections. Inside job Sometimes Ukrainians collaborating with occupying Russian forces have enabled the plunder. After Russian forces captured Kherson in March last year, Alina Dotsenko and her colleagues fabricated an elaborate lie to try to protect the paintings and sculptures in the city’s art museum. They told the Russians that the museum was under renovation and that the art collection had been removed. For several months, Dotsenko said, the ruse worked. But several Ukrainians in league with the occupying forces gave away their secret, and the Russians eventually learned that the art was still in the building, hidden in a storage area. Before Kherson fell, Dotsenko had made backup copies of the electronic inventory for the museum’s collection and removed any record of it from the building. But a former colleague, she later learned, had also made a copy of the archive and gave it to the Russians. Soon after the convoy of Russian trucks left the museum loaded with thousands of artworks in November, photos appeared indicating the trucks had arrived at a museum in Russian-occupied Crimea. Ihor Poshyvailo, a co-founder of the Heritage Emergency Response Initiative, works with his crew to salvage the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which was damaged by Russian shelling in March 2022. Bohdan Poshyvailo The director of the Central Museum of Taurida in Simferopol, Andriy Malgin, acknowledged to Radio Free Europe that much of Kherson art museum’s collection was now in Simferopol. He said the artworks were in storage to protect them. “These are not our paintings. We understand this very well. There are no attempts on our part to declare that they will remain with us or we will exhibit them. We just store them,” Malgin said. Now Dotsenko and others on the museum’s staff are working to calculate exactly what was taken away, even as Kherson continues to come under Russian shelling. One rare book in the museum’s collection, by one of Ukraine’s most celebrated poets, was rescued before the building was looted. As Russian occupying authorities were purging most of the museum’s staff, 66-year-old Galina Aksyutina, who oversaw the library, took a last look at the collection. She spotted an 1894 edition of \"Kobzar,\" by Taras Shevchenko, whose writings in the 19th century were censored by the Russian empire and are now seen as the foundation of modern Ukrainian literature. “I felt very sorry for this book. I thought this would be the first thing they destroy because of its symbolic meaning, as they destroy everything Ukrainian,” she said. She decided to hide the book under her clothes. “When I was leaving the museum, I was nervous. The Russians looked through all my personal belongings, but they didn’t search me personally, so they didn’t notice the book I took out.” The book, she said, is now safely back at the museum.

Experts say Russians are stealing art from Ukrainian museums 02:02 Link copied April 6, 2023, 10:30 AM UTC By Yasmine Salam and Dan De Luce Last fall, Ukrainian troops were closing in on Kherson, rolling back Russian forces who had seized the city after Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine. At the Kherson Regional Art Museum, a team of armed Russians in civilian clothes arrived along with several large trucks and buses. Over five days, they hauled away more than 11,000 pieces of art, including paintings, sculptures, graphics and other works from Ukraine and around the world, said Alina Dotsenko, the director of the museum.

Dimitar Dilkoff / AFP via Getty Images file “It was obvious that it was all planned. The decision to loot the museum was not made on the spot,” Dotsenko said. “It was all carefully planned.” The theft, verified by human rights monitors and independent scholars, was not an isolated incident. A growing body of evidence suggests Russian forces are systematically stealing art and cultural artifacts from Ukraine on a scale not seen in Europe since the Nazi plunder of World War II, according to researchers and experts documenting the damage. The theft includes precious Scythian gold jewelry dating to the fourth century B.C., ancient coins and thousands of paintings from museums and private collections, researchers said. Some art and cultural sites have been severely damaged and destroyed, including centuries-old Orthodox Christian churches, libraries and paintings by one of Ukraine’s most beloved artists, Maria Prymachenko, whose work was hailed by Pablo Picasso as an “artistic miracle.” Russians in plainclothes load stolen artwork from the Kherson Regional Art Museum into the back of a truck in November. Courtesy Kherson Regional Art Museum The organized campaign of looting and destruction, targeting hundreds of cultural monuments, churches and museums, appears aimed at wiping out Ukraine’s history and cultural identity, experts said. Before he ordered the Feb. 24, 2022, invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin repeatedly argued that the idea of a separate Ukrainian national identity was fiction, that Ukraine lacked “real statehood” and that it was part of Russia’s “own history, culture, spiritual space.” “They are trying to erase Ukrainian identity, just the way the Nazis did,” said Chris Marinello, an art restitution lawyer and the founder of a stolen and looted art recovery firm. Ancient Scythian gold jewelry was among the artifacts Russian forces stole in Ukraine, researchers and museum staff members say. A. Dagli Orti / De Agostini via Getty Images file Putin’s “forces have bombed, shelled and destroyed hundreds of sites and places that epitomize Ukrainian identity and heritage — from churches and museums to archaeological sites and monuments,” said Richard Kurin, the ambassador-at-large of the Smithsonian Institution. “He seeks to eliminate the physical markers of Ukraine’s distinctive culture so as to conform to his warped view that there is no such culture.” The Russian Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. In some cases, museums or other cultural sites have been targeted far away from any front line, according to satellite imagery and researchers on the ground. Just days after the Feb. 24 invasion, the Ivankiv Historical and Local History Museum near Kyiv came under bombardment, even though it was not near any fighting or military targets, according to researchers. The shelling ignited a fire that destroyed and damaged multiple works by Prymachenko, whose vivid, fantastical paintings of animals inspired painter Marc Chagall. Satellite imagery shows the Ivankiv Historical and Local History Museum on Feb. 14, 2022, left, before the invasion, and after it was damaged by Russian shelling on Feb. 27. Maxar The attack on the Ivankiv museum is part of a pattern of “targeted destruction” of cultural sites, said Katharyn Hanson, the head of research at the Smithsonian Cultural Rescue Initiative. The theft of priceless art in areas seized by Russian forces cannot be explained as random or spontaneous acts by Russian soldiers, Hanson said. “Our research suggests that this looting is state-sponsored by Russia,” Hanson said. Hanson is one of the authors of a report due to be released this month by the Smithsonian Cultural Rescue Initiative examining the plunder of cultural heritage in Ukraine since the Russian invasion. In a modern version of the World War II-era effort to save artistic treasures from German looting depicted in the Hollywood film “Monuments Men,” Hanson is part of a team of archaeologists, historians, satellite imagery experts and other scholars trying to document the assault on Ukraine’s cultural sites. Using satellite photos, thermal imaging, artificial intelligence tools and on-the-ground research, the U.S.-funded Smithsonian team is sometimes able to verify an incident within hours after it occurs, said Susan Wolfinbarger, the team lead in the State Department’s Office of Advanced Analytics . “We’re really leveraging new technologies, new data feeds, to help us both document these things but to also do it quickly and at a scale that really hasn’t been previously attempted,” Wolfinbarger said. Using a database of more than 28,000 cultural sites in Ukraine, the Smithsonian team was able to spot an attack on the museum in Ivankiv from a combination of thermal imaging from NASA and commercial satellite photos, she said. The Smithsonian initiative is part of a wider $6 million effort funded by the Biden administration — involving a variety of American research centers — to collect evidence for possible international war crimes investigations. Russian forces targeted cultural monuments earlier in the conflict, after having seized the Crimean Peninsula and parts of eastern Ukraine more than eight years ago, said Matthew Steinhelfer, the deputy assistant secretary for the State Department’s Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations. Russian forces left behind empty picture frames after they hauled away paintings from the Kherson Regional Art Museum. Kherson Regional Art Museum “We’ve seen this playbook before,” he said. “We’ve seen this since 2014, where Russia has removed artifacts, demolished gravesites and shuttered churches in the Donbas region and Crimea.” The Hague Convention of 1954 prohibits militaries from targeting and looting museums or other cultural sites. In war crimes trials for conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and Mali, international prosecutors won convictions that cited attacks on religious and cultural monuments. As of March, UNESCO said it had verified damage to 248 cultural sites in Ukraine, including 107 religious sites and 12 libraries. “We have this list of verified damage, and the numbers keep growing,” said Krista Pikkat, UNESCO’s director for culture and emergencies. The World Bank recently estimated that the cost of the damage so far to Ukraine’s cultural buildings and art collections from the invasion amounts to nearly $2 billion. International cultural organizations and Interpol are warning authorities across Europe and around the world to be on the lookout for art stolen from Ukraine. The International Council of Museums has issued an “emergency red list” of artworks at risk, which UNESCO now uses to train border officials in other countries, U.N. officials said. Works by Ukrainian artist Maria Prymachenko that were rescued from Ivankiv on display in Lviv on Aug. 23. Jeff J. Mitchell / Getty Images file Last year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials seized three ancient swords dating to the fifth or sixth century, as well as an ancient stone ax head, at New York’s JFK Airport, all stolen from Ukraine. They were returned to the government in a ceremony last month at Ukraine’s embassy in Washington. When Ukrainian art and artifacts have been looted, Russian troops are often helped by Russian experts who travel to seized territory and know the country’s art collections, say experts in and outside Ukraine. “There are expert groups who were specially commissioned to come to Ukraine,” said Ihor Poshyvailo, a Ukrainian curator who was trained by the Smithsonian team before the invasion. “They were hunting for historic objects,” said Poshyvailo, a co-founder of the Heritage Emergency Response Initiative, which tries to help repair and preserve Ukraine’s cultural heritage collections. Inside job Sometimes Ukrainians collaborating with occupying Russian forces have enabled the plunder. After Russian forces captured Kherson in March last year, Alina Dotsenko and her colleagues fabricated an elaborate lie to try to protect the paintings and sculptures in the city’s art museum. They told the Russians that the museum was under renovation and that the art collection had been removed. For several months, Dotsenko said, the ruse worked. But several Ukrainians in league with the occupying forces gave away their secret, and the Russians eventually learned that the art was still in the building, hidden in a storage area. Before Kherson fell, Dotsenko had made backup copies of the electronic inventory for the museum’s collection and removed any record of it from the building. But a former colleague, she later learned, had also made a copy of the archive and gave it to the Russians. Soon after the convoy of Russian trucks left the museum loaded with thousands of artworks in November, photos appeared indicating the trucks had arrived at a museum in Russian-occupied Crimea. Ihor Poshyvailo, a co-founder of the Heritage Emergency Response Initiative, works with his crew to salvage the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which was damaged by Russian shelling in March 2022. Bohdan Poshyvailo The director of the Central Museum of Taurida in Simferopol, Andriy Malgin, acknowledged to Radio Free Europe that much of Kherson art museum’s collection was now in Simferopol. He said the artworks were in storage to protect them. “These are not our paintings. We understand this very well. There are no attempts on our part to declare that they will remain with us or we will exhibit them. We just store them,” Malgin said. Now Dotsenko and others on the museum’s staff are working to calculate exactly what was taken away, even as Kherson continues to come under Russian shelling. One rare book in the museum’s collection, by one of Ukraine’s most celebrated poets, was rescued before the building was looted. As Russian occupying authorities were purging most of the museum’s staff, 66-year-old Galina Aksyutina, who oversaw the library, took a last look at the collection. She spotted an 1894 edition of \"Kobzar,\" by Taras Shevchenko, whose writings in the 19th century were censored by the Russian empire and are now seen as the foundation of modern Ukrainian literature. “I felt very sorry for this book. I thought this would be the first thing they destroy because of its symbolic meaning, as they destroy everything Ukrainian,” she said. She decided to hide the book under her clothes. “When I was leaving the museum, I was nervous. The Russians looked through all my personal belongings, but they didn’t search me personally, so they didn’t notice the book I took out.” The book, she said, is now safely back at the museum.

Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images file Link copied April 2, 2023, 12:00 PM UTC By Evan Bush People have worked for a century to make California’s Tulare Basin into a food grower’s paradise. That pastoral landscape now looks more like the Pacific Ocean in many areas. Months of atmospheric river storms have pummeled the area and saturated the basin’s soil, which sits about halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles, not far from Fresno. The rains have led to floods that damaged towns and deluged farms and have begun to refill what was once a sprawling lake. The floods have pitted neighboring property owners against one another and raised tensions over how to manage the flows, which have damaged hundreds of structures. And more water is on the way. Heavy rain in California easing historic drought March 17, 2023 01:27 Experts say a monthslong, slow-burning crisis will play out next: A historic snowpack looms in the mountains above the basin — as it melts, it is likely to put downstream communities through months of torment. The flooding, which follows several years of extreme drought, showcases the weather whiplash typical of California, which vacillates between too wet and too dry. The influence of climate change can make the state’s extremes more intense. “This is a slowly unfolding natural disaster,” said Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow at the Water Policy Center of the Public Policy Institute of California. “There’s no way to handle it with the existing infrastructure.” The re-forming Tulare Lake — which was drained for farming a century ago — could remain on the landscape for years, disrupting growers in a region that produces a significant proportion of the nation’s supply of almonds, pistachios, milk and fruit. High-stakes decisions over where that water travels could resonate across the country’s grocery store shelves. In the farming communities that dot the historic lake bed, accusations of sabotaged levees, frantic efforts to patch breached banks and feuds — common occurrences during flood fights in the area — have started already, said Matt Hurley, a former water manager for several water districts in the Tulare Basin. Construction equipment for the California High Speed Rail project surrounded by flooding in Tulare County near Allensworth, Calif., on March 22. Patrick T. Fallon / AFP via Getty Images file In the nearby town of Allensworth last month, a dispute over a culvert caused anxiety and friction with the railroad that sends trains through town. Residents worked into the night to plug a culvert — a drain under Highway 43 — with plywood and sandbags in a desperate effort to keep floodwater out of town. But later that night, workers with the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad unblocked the pipe, which left some Allensworth residents fuming as water flowed closer. The residents had used BNSF materials without permission, said Lena Kent, a railroad spokesperson. Damming the culvert threatened the highway — the only access point to Allensworth at the time — and the rail tracks that run parallel to it. Stress levels could remain high for months. “The problem this year is it’s just begun. We may have water running at or near our flood level — in all of our streams, through August or September,” Hurley said. “This impending monster — a 50-foot-plus deep snowpack that we haven’t seen in 75 years —  is sitting up there, and we just don’t know how fast it’s going to turn into water and come out of the mountains.” The Tulare Basin is at the southern end of California’s San Joaquin Valley — and in essence, it’s a massive bowl. Before irrigators dug canals and rerouted water for farming in the late 1800s, Tulare Lake filled the bowl’s lower reaches. Shallow water stretched across the landscape, and the lake was the largest body of freshwater west of the Mississippi. A car is stranded on a flooded road near Corcoran, Calif., on March 23. David McNew / Getty Images file Several rivers — Kings, Tule, Kern and Kaweah — historically dead-ended at the lake and replenished its water levels every spring, but farmers have diverted and rerouted so much water that the lake bed is now usually dry. It’s among the most fertile farmland in the country. Today, the irrigation system is designed to “use every single drop of water” that flows into the basin, Mount said. In fact, through aggressive groundwater pumping, farmers collectively use more water than what would flow to the lake every year. Pumping has caused the land to sink dramatically — it has subsided in parts of the San Joaquin Valley by as much as 28 feet , according to the U.S. Geological Survey — deepening the bowl. This season, far more water is flowing than can be used. For about two weeks, farmers and emergency workers have been scrambling to plug levees and prevent the worst as the ground became saturated and rivers swelled after a seemingly endless series of atmospheric river storms battered California. The flooding has breached dozens of levees , forced rescues, swamped construction sites at California’s high-speed rail project and seeped into several communities, including Allensworth, a historic community that in 1908 was the first settlement west of the Mississippi to be founded and governed by Black Americans. “What you’re seeing now more than anything else is traditional flood problems,” Mount said. “All of that water is making its way into the bottom of the bowl and starting to fill the bowl.” What could come next is more unusual — and worrisome. The Sierra Nevada mountains, above the Tulare Basin, are storing two to three times as much water as snowpack as is normal. If the snow melts quickly, it will send floodwater churning toward the lake bottom. Tulare Lake refilled in 1997 and 1983 during very wet seasons. The snowpack is larger this year. “If we use 1983 as an example: They had more than 80,000 acres of land underwater. If it’s bigger than that, it could be as much as 100,000 acres underwater,” Mount said. Tulare County ranked second in the country for agricultural market value, according to the 2017 Census of Agriculture. The region produces almonds, oranges, pistachios, wine grapes, milk and cheese. “This has a ripple effect on the nation’s food supply,” Mount said. Floodwater from a break in levees surrounds a farm in Lemoore, Calif., on March 21. Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images file California officials have geared up for a long fight against flooding. Nearly 700 people were assigned to help with the emergency response just in Tulare County , where floodwater has damaged more than 900 structures so far. But sandbags and helicopter-delivered super sacks — bulk bags filled with rocks and other material — can do only so much. “At some point, you know, we do realize that there’s too much water, there’s more water in the Sierra than these facilities can handle,” Karla Nemeth, the director of the California Department of Water Resources, said at a recent media briefing. The agency will do the best it could to help mitigate damages, Nemeth said. Once water makes it to the historic lake bed, there will be few options to remove it, other than to wait for it to evaporate or to try to move it through canals and pump it away. Pumps are expensive and inefficient over such sprawling terrain. Differing levels of subsidence along the lake bed have changed the geometry of canals, which could complicate efforts to move water away. In 1983, remnants of Tulare Lake remained on the landscape for about two years, Mount said. Hurley estimated that if it floods again, the expense required to return the landscape to growing crops would be in the billions. The flooding could also spell disaster for farmworkers and those who live in the rural communities that dot the Tulare Basin. “This is a low-income community. People are not out here stocking up food. They go paycheck to paycheck in a lot of cases,” said Kayode Kadara, of Allensworth, a community organizer. “All we’ve heard so far is with this unprecedented snowfall, what we’ve seen so far is a baby flood.” For now, the best everyone can hope for is a cool summer — with a steady, manageable melt — and as much cooperation as they can muster.

The influence of climate change can make the state’s extremes more intense. “This is a slowly unfolding natural disaster,” said Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow at the Water Policy Center of the Public Policy Institute of California. “There’s no way to handle it with the existing infrastructure.” The re-forming Tulare Lake — which was drained for farming a century ago — could remain on the landscape for years, disrupting growers in a region that produces a significant proportion of the nation’s supply of almonds, pistachios, milk and fruit. High-stakes decisions over where that water travels could resonate across the country’s grocery store shelves. In the farming communities that dot the historic lake bed, accusations of sabotaged levees, frantic efforts to patch breached banks and feuds — common occurrences during flood fights in the area — have started already, said Matt Hurley, a former water manager for several water districts in the Tulare Basin.

Fallon / AFP via Getty Images file In the nearby town of Allensworth last month, a dispute over a culvert caused anxiety and friction with the railroad that sends trains through town. Residents worked into the night to plug a culvert — a drain under Highway 43 — with plywood and sandbags in a desperate effort to keep floodwater out of town. But later that night, workers with the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad unblocked the pipe, which left some Allensworth residents fuming as water flowed closer. The residents had used BNSF materials without permission, said Lena Kent, a railroad spokesperson. Damming the culvert threatened the highway — the only access point to Allensworth at the time — and the rail tracks that run parallel to it. Stress levels could remain high for months. “The problem this year is it’s just begun. We may have water running at or near our flood level — in all of our streams, through August or September,” Hurley said. “This impending monster — a 50-foot-plus deep snowpack that we haven’t seen in 75 years —  is sitting up there, and we just don’t know how fast it’s going to turn into water and come out of the mountains.” The Tulare Basin is at the southern end of California’s San Joaquin Valley — and in essence, it’s a massive bowl. Before irrigators dug canals and rerouted water for farming in the late 1800s, Tulare Lake filled the bowl’s lower reaches. Shallow water stretched across the landscape, and the lake was the largest body of freshwater west of the Mississippi. A car is stranded on a flooded road near Corcoran, Calif., on March 23. David McNew / Getty Images file Several rivers — Kings, Tule, Kern and Kaweah — historically dead-ended at the lake and replenished its water levels every spring, but farmers have diverted and rerouted so much water that the lake bed is now usually dry. It’s among the most fertile farmland in the country. Today, the irrigation system is designed to “use every single drop of water” that flows into the basin, Mount said. In fact, through aggressive groundwater pumping, farmers collectively use more water than what would flow to the lake every year. Pumping has caused the land to sink dramatically — it has subsided in parts of the San Joaquin Valley by as much as 28 feet , according to the U.S. Geological Survey — deepening the bowl. This season, far more water is flowing than can be used. For about two weeks, farmers and emergency workers have been scrambling to plug levees and prevent the worst as the ground became saturated and rivers swelled after a seemingly endless series of atmospheric river storms battered California. The flooding has breached dozens of levees , forced rescues, swamped construction sites at California’s high-speed rail project and seeped into several communities, including Allensworth, a historic community that in 1908 was the first settlement west of the Mississippi to be founded and governed by Black Americans. “What you’re seeing now more than anything else is traditional flood problems,” Mount said. “All of that water is making its way into the bottom of the bowl and starting to fill the bowl.” What could come next is more unusual — and worrisome. The Sierra Nevada mountains, above the Tulare Basin, are storing two to three times as much water as snowpack as is normal. If the snow melts quickly, it will send floodwater churning toward the lake bottom. Tulare Lake refilled in 1997 and 1983 during very wet seasons. The snowpack is larger this year. “If we use 1983 as an example: They had more than 80,000 acres of land underwater. If it’s bigger than that, it could be as much as 100,000 acres underwater,” Mount said. Tulare County ranked second in the country for agricultural market value, according to the 2017 Census of Agriculture. The region produces almonds, oranges, pistachios, wine grapes, milk and cheese. “This has a ripple effect on the nation’s food supply,” Mount said. Floodwater from a break in levees surrounds a farm in Lemoore, Calif., on March 21. Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images file California officials have geared up for a long fight against flooding. Nearly 700 people were assigned to help with the emergency response just in Tulare County , where floodwater has damaged more than 900 structures so far. But sandbags and helicopter-delivered super sacks — bulk bags filled with rocks and other material — can do only so much. “At some point, you know, we do realize that there’s too much water, there’s more water in the Sierra than these facilities can handle,” Karla Nemeth, the director of the California Department of Water Resources, said at a recent media briefing. The agency will do the best it could to help mitigate damages, Nemeth said. Once water makes it to the historic lake bed, there will be few options to remove it, other than to wait for it to evaporate or to try to move it through canals and pump it away. Pumps are expensive and inefficient over such sprawling terrain. Differing levels of subsidence along the lake bed have changed the geometry of canals, which could complicate efforts to move water away. In 1983, remnants of Tulare Lake remained on the landscape for about two years, Mount said. Hurley estimated that if it floods again, the expense required to return the landscape to growing crops would be in the billions. The flooding could also spell disaster for farmworkers and those who live in the rural communities that dot the Tulare Basin. “This is a low-income community. People are not out here stocking up food. They go paycheck to paycheck in a lot of cases,” said Kayode Kadara, of Allensworth, a community organizer. “All we’ve heard so far is with this unprecedented snowfall, what we’ve seen so far is a baby flood.” For now, the best everyone can hope for is a cool summer — with a steady, manageable melt — and as much cooperation as they can muster.

Chinese spy balloon gathered intelligence from U.S. military sites, officials say 01:28 Link copied April 3, 2023, 10:30 AM UTC By Courtney Kube and Carol E. Lee The Chinese spy balloon that flew across the U.S. was able to gather intelligence from several sensitive American military sites, despite the Biden administration’s efforts to block it from doing so, according to two current senior U.S. officials and one former senior administration official. China was able to control the balloon so it could make multiple passes over some of the sites (at times flying figure-eight formations) and transmit the information it collected back to Beijing in real time, the three officials said. The intelligence China collected was mostly from electronic signals, which can be picked up from weapons systems or include communications from base personnel, rather than images, the officials said. The three officials said China could have gathered much more intelligence from sensitive sites if not for the administration’s efforts to move around potential targets and obscure the balloon’s ability to pick up their electronic signals by stopping them from broadcasting or emitting signals. State Dept. briefing makes it official: Chinese balloon was ‘trying to eavesdrop’ Feb. 9, 2023 03:46 The Defense Department directed NBC News to comments senior officials made in February that the balloon had “limited additive value” for intelligence collection by the Chinese government “over and above what [China] is likely able to collect through things like satellites in low earth orbit.” On Monday, a Defense Department spokesperson reiterated that any intelligence collected had \"limited additive value\" for China and said she could not confirm that the balloon had transmitted any information back to China in \"real time.\" National Security Council spokesperson Kirby John declined to answer questions Monday afternoon about what kind of electronic signals or communications the balloon could have accessed. “Knowing it was going to enter U.S. airspace we took action to limit the ability of this balloon to garner anything of additive or especially useful content,” said Kirby. “So again, I won’t get ahead of what we’re learning off this thing.” Montana Sen. Steve Daines, a Republican, said, “The administration’s explanation that the balloon had ‘limited additive value’ is little comfort to Montanans and the American people and weak spin on an issue the administration mishandled from start to finish.” Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee said, \"We have consistently learned more from press reports about the Chinese surveillance balloon than we have from administration officials. ... I intend to hold this administration accountable.\" China has said repeatedly that the balloon was an unmanned civilian airship that accidentally strayed off course, and that the U.S. overreacted by shooting it down . Officials have not said which company, department or organization the balloon belonged to, despite several requests for comment by NBC News. After the balloon was shot down in February, Biden administration officials said it was capable of collecting signals intelligence. The balloon had a self-destruct mechanism that could have been activated remotely by China, but the officials said it’s not clear if that didn’t happen because the mechanism malfunctioned or because China decided not to trigger it. The balloon entered U.S. airspace over Alaska on Jan. 28, according to the Biden administration, which said it was tracking it as it moved. Within the next four days, the balloon was flying over Montana — specifically Malmstrom Air Force Base, where the U.S. stores some of its nuclear assets. On Feb. 2, NBC News was first to report that the Chinese spy balloon was flying over the U.S. and that President Joe Biden had considered shooting it down, prompting the administration to publicly confirm that and disclose it had been monitoring the balloon for days. Once the balloon’s existence became public, China increased its speed, officials said, in attempt to get it out of U.S. airspace as quickly as possible. China accuses U.S. of ‘escalating crises’ after downing suspected spy balloon Feb. 16, 2023 01:10 The U.S. shot down the balloon on Feb. 4 off the coast of South Carolina, and officials are still analyzing the debris that was retrieved. At the time, the U.S. government said it waited to shoot the balloon down until it was over the ocean to avoid any damage or casualties on the ground. The balloon, which was nearly as large as three school buses, would have had a large debris field that U.S. officials could not control as it fell to the earth. “U.S. military commanders had determined downing the balloon while over land posed an undue risk to people across a wide area due to the size and altitude of the balloon and its surveillance payload,” Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement after the balloon was downed. Officials have tried to reconstruct the balloon from the recovered debris.

In Trump’s narrative, the cases are meritless, the prosecutors are liberals, and his critics are conspiring to wield the law against him unfairly — all with the aim of stopping him from becoming president in 2024.

A “lunatic,” he said. His legal woes in Georgia due to his asking Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” enough votes to overturn his 2020 defeat? He said the phone call was “perfect.” And the case is about trying “to interfere with the 2024 election.” He also went after New York Attorney General Letitia James as an anti-Trump political actor for the civil case involving him. “It’s cost hundreds of millions of dollars to defend,” he said, vowing not to settle it. The Mar-a-Lago crowd booed the names as he mentioned them. Trump is the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, and his speech was an attempt to give his supporters a permission structure to minimize further legal woes he anticipates. It’s an open question whether any of his Republican rivals will challenge his claims. So far, they’ve rushed to defend him .

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., and Ronny Jackson, R-Texas. “We are a nation in decline, and now these radical left lunatics want to interfere in elections by using law enforcement,” Trump said, tying his prosecution and the multiple investigations he faces to his false claims of a rigged election in 2020. “We can’t let that happen.” Speaking for less than 30 minutes, Trump was subdued, and it seemed that the day had taken its toll on him. But he didn’t stop with lambasting the case in New York. Rather, he turned his attention to additional legal jeopardy he faces. Read the full story here.

But after Trump’s arraignment today, one of the officials said the intelligence community is watching “very closely” for any signs of such interference. Intelligence officials are particularly looking for any Chinese or Russian efforts to stir up a response to Trump’s indictment and subsequent arraignment, such as protests, this official said. They are more concerned about Russia’s trying to stir the pot with disinformation, through social media or other outlets, the two officials said. Russia has shown a willingness and the capability to interfere in the U.S. political process, most notably in the 2016 presidential election, and China has increasingly sought to mirror those efforts.

Trump has not been charged with conspiracy. The indictment does not say exactly what crime Bragg alleges as the secondary offense being covered up — what elevated the business records crimes to felonies. Rather, the statement of facts that accompanies the indictment says the falsification was intended \"to conceal criminal conduct that hid damaging information from the voting public during the 2016 presidential election.\" The indictment details two hush money payments made to women who alleged having affairs with Trump, reciting facts that have long been known. It also cites a third payment to a doorman who supposedly was claiming that Trump fathered a child with a housekeeper. It alleges that the scheme to conceal the payments was illegal, but it does not name the statutes the scheme violated. The indictment alleges a criminal scheme to hide crucial information from the voters. But the only charges are falsification of business records. There are counts for each of the three types of false entries for 11 payments that were made on or around each of: 2/14/17, 3/17/17, 4/13/17, 5/23/17, 6/19/17, 7/11/17, 8/1/17, 9/11/17, 10/18/17, 11/20/17 and 12/1/17. The statement of facts describes the larger case, including the so-called catch-and-kill scheme and the Karen McDougal payment. However, the actual charges appear to concern only those records intended to hide the payments to former Trump attorney Michael Cohen for the Stormy Daniels settlement.

And if the Secret Service has its way, there will be a major effort to keep Trump out of the view of people outside.

A special grand jury in Georgia spent a year investigating election interference by Trump and his allies and recommended indictments for multiple people on a variety of charges . In Washington, Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith is investigating some of the same conduct, while also pursuing a separate investigation into whether Trump obstructed justice or otherwise violated federal law in connection with the highly classified documents found in an FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago compound. There is no way to know whether those cases will lead to Trump's being charged, but they appear to pose serious legal threats. If the New York case plays out as expected, the most serious charge carries a four-year prison sentence. But former Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance told NBC News this week that prison was an unlikely outcome in that case if Trump is tried and convicted. The potential crimes being examined in Georgia and Washington carry penalties of up to 20 years in prison.

Share this - Link copied 5d ago / 4:10 PM UTC Yamiche Alcindor The dueling, animated protest scenes playing out in New York today are a reminder that the way Americans view Trump’s legal problems is deeply tied to their political views and party affiliations. In large part, Republicans view the Manhattan case, as well as Trump’s other legal problems, as evidence of a large-scale \"deep state\" conspiracy to stop Trump from running and to go after conservatives as a whole. It’s also important to remember that Trump remains immensely popular, with a whopping 72% of GOP voters saying he has had a mainly positive impact on the Republican Party, versus 21% who say he’s had a negative impact, according to a recently released Quinnipiac University poll . Meanwhile, Democrats see the indictment and the investigations as evidence that no American is above the law. Still, Democratic voters also told me late last week that they are worried that Bragg's case might not end in a conviction and could end up helping Trump. That having been said, 62% of Americans overall said Bragg's case was mainly motivated by politics, according to another Quinnipiac University poll . The beliefs do vary starkly when you look at political affiliation: 93% of GOP voters and 70% of independent voters say the Manhattan case is motivated mainly by politics. Among Democrats, 66% said they think the case is motivated mainly by the law. Share this - Link copied 5d ago / 4:04 PM UTC Who is the judge presiding over Trump’s N.Y. criminal case?

His potential 2024 rivals have also backed him in the face of the indictment. \"It's wrong, and every American, Republican and Democrat, should be disgusted by this,\" McDaniel said.

Hyde-Smith said Trump’s prosecution is a “political stunt by a prosecutor whose campaign was funded by George Soros,” a liberal megadonor, who is Jewish. Her statement echoes Trump’s attacks against Bragg, whom he called an “animal” backed by Soros. She is the sixth senator endorsing Trump’s presidential bid.

Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and James Comer, R-Ky., released a joint statement expressing concern over a potential gag order on Trump. \"To put any restrictions on the ability of President Trump to discuss his mistreatment at the hands of this politically motivated prosecutor would only further demonstrate the weaponization of the New York justice system,\" they wrote. The judge could potentially issue a gag order , which would prevent the former president from talking publicly about the case if Merchan believed there was a \"reasonable likelihood\" that it could prevent a fair trial. Manhattan lawyers have suggested to NBC News that a gag order out of the gate might be unlikely . Trump has vocally protested against the indictment on social media and warned of \"potential death and destruction\" if he was charged. He has a right to defend himself, but he could potentially face additional legal trouble if he threatened the prosecutor.

Discovery handed over to the defense Within 15 days of arraignment, the prosecution must turn over all the evidence gathered as part of the investigation (known as “discovery”) to the defense team. This includes the minutes from the grand jury process, the testimony from every witness (sometimes with redactions), law enforcement notes of anyone interviewed (even if they didn’t testify in front of the grand jury), every exhibit put in front of the grand jury to substantiate the charges in the indictment, and other records prosecutors obtained through subpoenas (think telephone records, tapes, things of that nature). Motions, motions and more motions Trump’s defense team has already said it will quickly file motions in court to get the case dismissed before it ever reaches a jury. Generally, the defense side has 45 days to make motions after arraignment, but the judge has the discretion to grant the defense more time. Read the full story here.

While the post doesn’t mention Merchan by name, Trump refers to him as “THE HIGHLY PARTISAN JUDGE.” “HE WAS AN UNFAIR DISASTER ON A PREVIOUS TRUMP RELATED CASE, WOULDN’T RECUSE, GAVE HORRIBLE JURY INSTRUCTIONS, & IMPOSSIBLE TO DEAL WITH DURING THE WITCH HUNT TRIAL.” The post echoes previous comments from Trump complaining about the judge’s handling of the recent criminal tax fraud trial involving the Trump Organization , which was fined $1.6 million after being found guilty on all 17 counts.

Blagojevich, who was also a contestant on the 2010 season of Trump’s \"Celebrity Apprentice,\" said on Fox News this morning that Trump was being charged for “things that aren’t crimes” by “corrupt prosecutors.” Blagojevich, who still identifies as a Democrat, said the prosecution was a \"disgrace\" to his party and the country. On Newsmax, he compared Trump’s travails to his own his legal woes — he maintains his innocence. “If there was any crime here, it’s Stormy Daniels .

Donald Trump is only just beginning. After today’s arraignment, the legal process that unfolds could take months, if not much longer. Here’s what to expect next. Discovery handed over to defense Within 15 days of arraignment, the prosecution must turn over all the evidence that was gathered as part of the investigation (known as “discovery”) to the defense team.

Motions, motions and more motions Trump’s defense team has already said it will quickly file motions in court to get the case dismissed before it ever reaches a jury. Generally, the defense side has 45 days to make motions after arraignment, but the judge has the discretion to grant the defense more time. Without the benefit of seeing the actual indictment right now, it’s hard to know exactly how Trump’s team will attack the charges, but Trump himself has already floated the idea of filing a motion to transfer the case out of Manhattan. Motions to transfer venue are rarely granted and the defense team would need to convince the judge that Trump cannot get a fair trial in the city due to pretrial publicity. With the amount of national media attention this case has already generated — not only in New York — it’s going to be challenging to persuade Merchan to move the case elsewhere. “No judge is going to seriously entertain it. There’s no basis to conclude he can’t receive the same fair trial in New York as he would in Mississippi,” said Robert Gottlieb, a former assistant district attorney in Manhattan who is now in private practice. “New York jurors consider themselves smarter than everyone else and they will analyze this case to death — red or blue.” Other motions might hinge on arguments about the statute of limitations having expired, the nature of the charges involving federal campaign violations, or other attacks on the sufficiency of the evidence. Jeremy Saland, another former assistant district attorney, also suggested Trump’s team could file catch-all motion to dismiss the indictment — known as “ Clayton motion ” — seeking to have the judge toss the case out not on the merits, but in the interests of justice. Trump’s defense lawyers would most likely point to the fact that he wasn’t prosecuted by the previous district attorney. Trial The “speedy trial” rule in New York states that prosecutors must be ready to try a felony case within six months, but what’s on the books is different from what happens in reality. Former prosecutors familiar with trying criminal cases in New York predict this case is likely to take much, much longer to reach trial, if it gets that far. “In the ordinary circumstance, it could take a year to get to trial,” said Daniel Horwitz, a former assistant district attorney in Manhattan, who noted the process could drag on longer here depending on how many months it takes for the judge to resolve all the motions filed by Trump’s legal team. Saland agreed. “I could see this go north of year. They are going to file every motion in book.” Share this - Link copied 5d ago / 1:26 PM UTC Mike Memoli For those of us covering President Joe Biden, it continues to be a jarring split screen between how he and the former president are navigating this fraught political moment. As Trump is being arraigned in New York today, Biden will be meeting with his Council of Advisors on Science and Technology to discuss a topic that otherwise might have been of high interest — “the risks and opportunities posed by Artificial Intelligence technologies,” as a White House official puts it. The White House continues to take a very hands-off approach to the Trump indictment, deflecting most questions from reporters on the matter. So it's significant we heard as much from the president as we did yesterday while he was traveling in Minnesota. When asked if he’s worried about unrest, Biden said, “No, I have faith in the New York Police Department.” Then, asked if he has faith in the legal system, the president said, “Yes,” before departing the area. The White House’s approach to Trump is consistent with how the Biden campaign dealt with him in 2020. For most of the general election campaign, on a day-to-day basis, Biden’s events largely focused on his economic agenda or steps he would take to more responsibly handle the pandemic. But at select moments, he did give major addresses on the threats to democracy and the stakes of the election, in historic locales such as in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania,  and Warm Springs, Georgia.

Trump didn't get called for a case and was excused at the end of the day. \"It's a system, and we go through it. And it's a great system. It's a system that's works,\" he told reporters then.

The news organizations had also asked Merchan to permit the immediate unsealing of Trump’s indictment. The indictment has not been unsealed. In their letter opposing the media request, Trump’s lawyers had suggested that granting the level of media access sought by the coalition of news organizations would “create a circus-like atmosphere at the arraignment” and raise “unique security concerns.” Share this - Link copied 5d ago / 12:55 PM UTC As Trump faces arraignment, the soon-to-be-married await joyously nearby David K.

Supporters have been telling NBC News over the past few weeks that they didn’t often gather together in West Palm Beach — that is, until the FBI search of Trump's home in August. It was that moment that really struck a chord, these supporters say, and they’ve been spending nearly every weekend — and many weekdays — outside the residence waving flags, playing country music and encouraging cars and trucks driving to and from Palm Beach to honk their horns in support of the 45th president. The reaction of Trump’s supporters to news of his indictment and today’s arraignment hits both ends of the emotional spectrum. “I laughed pretty hard cause I knew it was a political hit job,” Donald Tarca Jr. said. “I was furious, because, first of all, how many other people tried to indict him on it, and they abandoned the idea,” Bob Voelker said. “Now this fat slob from New York, trying to make a name for himself, decides, 'Oh, I’m going to go after him so that I’ll get a big position in government.'

Trump was arraigned before Judge Juan Merchan this afternoon on the charges, which resulted from an investigation by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Anti-Trump and pro-Trump protesters, as well as the media, flooded the area outside the courthouse. Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and George Santos, R-N.Y., made brief stops to join Trump supporters protesting his indictment but left amid the chaos. Trump gave a speech tonight at Mar-a-Lago.

In Trump’s narrative, the cases are meritless, the prosecutors are liberals, and his critics are conspiring to wield the law against him unfairly — all with the aim of stopping him from becoming president in 2024. The Manhattan case? A “ridiculous indictment,” he said, and “the criminal is the district attorney.” Donald Trump arrives at the Manhattan Criminal Court on April 4, 2023. Kena Betancur / Getty Images The probe in Washington involving misuse of presidential records? “Gun-toting” FBI agents targeted him wrongly, he said. “There is no criminality.” The special counsel charged with looking into it? A “lunatic,” he said. His legal woes in Georgia due to his asking Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” enough votes to overturn his 2020 defeat? He said the phone call was “perfect.” And the case is about trying “to interfere with the 2024 election.” He also went after New York Attorney General Letitia James as an anti-Trump political actor for the civil case involving him. “It’s cost hundreds of millions of dollars to defend,” he said, vowing not to settle it. The Mar-a-Lago crowd booed the names as he mentioned them. Trump is the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, and his speech was an attempt to give his supporters a permission structure to minimize further legal woes he anticipates. It’s an open question whether any of his Republican rivals will challenge his claims. So far, they’ve rushed to defend him .

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., and Ronny Jackson, R-Texas. “We are a nation in decline, and now these radical left lunatics want to interfere in elections by using law enforcement,” Trump said, tying his prosecution and the multiple investigations he faces to his false claims of a rigged election in 2020. “We can’t let that happen.” Speaking for less than 30 minutes, Trump was subdued, and it seemed that the day had taken its toll on him. But he didn’t stop with lambasting the case in New York. Rather, he turned his attention to additional legal jeopardy he faces. Read the full story here.

Supporters and opponents of former President Donald Trump gather outside Manhattan Criminal Court during his arraignment in New York City on Tuesday. Spencer Platt / Getty Images Officials have been on alert since the indictment was confirmed last week and so far have not seen significant signs of Russian or Chinese interference in the country’s political discourse beyond the efforts that have become standard, the U.S. officials said. But after Trump’s arraignment today, one of the officials said the intelligence community is watching “very closely” for any signs of such interference. Intelligence officials are particularly looking for any Chinese or Russian efforts to stir up a response to Trump’s indictment and subsequent arraignment, such as protests, this official said. They are more concerned about Russia’s trying to stir the pot with disinformation, through social media or other outlets, the two officials said. Russia has shown a willingness and the capability to interfere in the U.S. political process, most notably in the 2016 presidential election, and China has increasingly sought to mirror those efforts.

Responding to Tacopina's comments, Conroy said prosecutors believed it was a potential concern, arguing that \"there were some privileged conversations between them.\" Judge Merchan said he would welcome a motion on the issue but said, \"At this point, I’m not making any findings of fact.\" Share this - Link copied 5d ago / 10:46 PM UTC Trump lands in Florida after arraignment Monica Dunn Trump's plane has landed at Palm Beach International Airport.

Defense lawyer Todd Blanche responded that spring 2024 was a more realistic target. \"The people and certainly the President wants this behind him. But, to sit here and say January of 2024 is good with us when we have not seen a piece of paper yet, is I think patently unfair for us,\" he said.

Since that time, we've had more evidence made available to the office and opportunity to meet with additional witnesses.\" Asked about his pursuit of the case after federal prosecutors turned it down, Bragg said New York state, which he called the business capital of the world, had an \"independent interest\" in maintaining the integrity of record-keeping. \"We regularly do cases involving false business statements,\" Bragg said. \"The basis for business integrity and a well-functioning business marketplace is true and accurate record-keeping. That's the charge at fault here — falsifying New York state business records.\" Bragg had said that the case resembled the \"bread and butter\" of his office's white-collar work involving tax violations. \"At its core, this case today is one with allegations like so many of our white-collar cases: allegations that someone lied again and again to protect their interests and evade the laws to which we are all held accountable,\" Bragg had said. \"We today uphold our solemn responsibility to ensure that everyone stands equal before the law.

It says the scheme involved a $30,000 payoff to a doorman who was trying to sell information about a child that Trump allegedly fathered out of wedlock, $150,000 to \"Woman 1\" (former Playboy model Karen McDougal ) who alleged an affair with Trump and a $130,000 payment to \"Woman 2\" (Stormy Daniels) over the rights to her story.

But he didn't rule out one in the future. Merchan said at Tuesday's hearing that Trump and potential witnesses should refrain from statements that might incite violence or unrest and avoid words or conduct that undermine the rule of law. Merchan said that if he saw such posts in the future, he'd have to take a closer look.

Trump has not been charged with conspiracy. The indictment does not say exactly what crime Bragg alleges as the secondary offense being covered up — what elevated the business records crimes to felonies. Rather, the statement of facts that accompanies the indictment says the falsification was intended \"to conceal criminal conduct that hid damaging information from the voting public during the 2016 presidential election.\" The indictment details two hush money payments made to women who alleged having affairs with Trump, reciting facts that have long been known. It also cites a third payment to a doorman who supposedly was claiming that Trump fathered a child with a housekeeper. It alleges that the scheme to conceal the payments was illegal, but it does not name the statutes the scheme violated. The indictment alleges a criminal scheme to hide crucial information from the voters. But the only charges are falsification of business records. There are counts for each of the three types of false entries for 11 payments that were made on or around each of: 2/14/17, 3/17/17, 4/13/17, 5/23/17, 6/19/17, 7/11/17, 8/1/17, 9/11/17, 10/18/17, 11/20/17 and 12/1/17. The statement of facts describes the larger case, including the so-called catch-and-kill scheme and the Karen McDougal payment. However, the actual charges appear to concern only those records intended to hide the payments to former Trump attorney Michael Cohen for the Stormy Daniels settlement.

A special grand jury in Georgia spent a year investigating election interference by Trump and his allies and recommended indictments for multiple people on a variety of charges . In Washington, Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith is investigating some of the same conduct, while also pursuing a separate investigation into whether Trump obstructed justice or otherwise violated federal law in connection with the highly classified documents found in an FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago compound. There is no way to know whether those cases will lead to Trump's being charged, but they appear to pose serious legal threats. If the New York case plays out as expected, the most serious charge carries a four-year prison sentence. But former Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance told NBC News this week that prison was an unlikely outcome in that case if Trump is tried and convicted. The potential crimes being examined in Georgia and Washington carry penalties of up to 20 years in prison.

Share this - Link copied 5d ago / 4:10 PM UTC Yamiche Alcindor The dueling, animated protest scenes playing out in New York today are a reminder that the way Americans view Trump’s legal problems is deeply tied to their political views and party affiliations. In large part, Republicans view the Manhattan case, as well as Trump’s other legal problems, as evidence of a large-scale \"deep state\" conspiracy to stop Trump from running and to go after conservatives as a whole. It’s also important to remember that Trump remains immensely popular, with a whopping 72% of GOP voters saying he has had a mainly positive impact on the Republican Party, versus 21% who say he’s had a negative impact, according to a recently released Quinnipiac University poll . Meanwhile, Democrats see the indictment and the investigations as evidence that no American is above the law. Still, Democratic voters also told me late last week that they are worried that Bragg's case might not end in a conviction and could end up helping Trump. That having been said, 62% of Americans overall said Bragg's case was mainly motivated by politics, according to another Quinnipiac University poll . The beliefs do vary starkly when you look at political affiliation: 93% of GOP voters and 70% of independent voters say the Manhattan case is motivated mainly by politics. Among Democrats, 66% said they think the case is motivated mainly by the law. Share this - Link copied 5d ago / 4:04 PM UTC Who is the judge presiding over Trump’s N.Y. criminal case?

Generally, the defense side has 45 days to make motions after arraignment, but the judge has the discretion to grant the defense more time. Without the benefit of seeing the actual indictment right now, it’s hard to know exactly how Trump’s team will attack the charges, but Trump himself has already floated the idea of filing a motion to transfer the case out of Manhattan. Motions to transfer venue are rarely granted and the defense team would need to convince the judge that Trump cannot get a fair trial in the city due to pretrial publicity. With the amount of national media attention this case has already generated — not only in New York — it’s going to be challenging to persuade Merchan to move the case elsewhere. “No judge is going to seriously entertain it. There’s no basis to conclude he can’t receive the same fair trial in New York as he would in Mississippi,” said Robert Gottlieb, a former assistant district attorney in Manhattan who is now in private practice. “New York jurors consider themselves smarter than everyone else and they will analyze this case to death — red or blue.” Other motions might hinge on arguments about the statute of limitations having expired, the nature of the charges involving federal campaign violations, or other attacks on the sufficiency of the evidence. Jeremy Saland, another former assistant district attorney, also suggested Trump’s team could file catch-all motion to dismiss the indictment — known as “ Clayton motion ” — seeking to have the judge toss the case out not on the merits, but in the interests of justice. Trump’s defense lawyers would most likely point to the fact that he wasn’t prosecuted by the previous district attorney. Trial The “speedy trial” rule in New York states that prosecutors must be ready to try a felony case within six months, but what’s on the books is different from what happens in reality. Former prosecutors familiar with trying criminal cases in New York predict this case is likely to take much, much longer to reach trial, if it gets that far. “In the ordinary circumstance, it could take a year to get to trial,” said Daniel Horwitz, a former assistant district attorney in Manhattan, who noted the process could drag on longer here depending on how many months it takes for the judge to resolve all the motions filed by Trump’s legal team. Saland agreed. “I could see this go north of year. They are going to file every motion in book.” Share this - Link copied 5d ago / 1:26 PM UTC Mike Memoli For those of us covering President Joe Biden, it continues to be a jarring split screen between how he and the former president are navigating this fraught political moment. As Trump is being arraigned in New York today, Biden will be meeting with his Council of Advisors on Science and Technology to discuss a topic that otherwise might have been of high interest — “the risks and opportunities posed by Artificial Intelligence technologies,” as a White House official puts it. The White House continues to take a very hands-off approach to the Trump indictment, deflecting most questions from reporters on the matter. So it's significant we heard as much from the president as we did yesterday while he was traveling in Minnesota. When asked if he’s worried about unrest, Biden said, “No, I have faith in the New York Police Department.” Then, asked if he has faith in the legal system, the president said, “Yes,” before departing the area. The White House’s approach to Trump is consistent with how the Biden campaign dealt with him in 2020. For most of the general election campaign, on a day-to-day basis, Biden’s events largely focused on his economic agenda or steps he would take to more responsibly handle the pandemic. But at select moments, he did give major addresses on the threats to democracy and the stakes of the election, in historic locales such as in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania,  and Warm Springs, Georgia.

The news organizations had also asked Merchan to permit the immediate unsealing of Trump’s indictment. The indictment has not been unsealed.

The reaction of Trump’s supporters to news of his indictment and today’s arraignment hits both ends of the emotional spectrum. “I laughed pretty hard cause I knew it was a political hit job,” Donald Tarca Jr. said. “I was furious, because, first of all, how many other people tried to indict him on it, and they abandoned the idea,” Bob Voelker said. “Now this fat slob from New York, trying to make a name for himself, decides, 'Oh, I’m going to go after him so that I’ll get a big position in government.'

Bud Light partnership with trans influencer sparks online protests 02:00 Link copied April 5, 2023, 5:32 PM UTC By Jay Valle March Madness may be over, but the right-wing fury directed toward Bud Light and one of its partners during the annual NCAA basketball tournament is still simmering. On Sunday, the day of the women’s final and the day before the men’s championship, transgender social media influencer Dylan Mulvaney, 26, shared a sponsored post on her Instagram account promoting Bud Light’s March Madness contest. Backlash from conservatives, who have already made Mulvaney — best known for her “Days of Girlhood” TikTok series — one of their favorite targets , was swift, especially across social media. In the two days since Mulvaney’s post about Bud Light, which is owned by Anheuser-Busch, countless videos have been shared online showing consumers dumping their Bud Light products in trash bins and down sinks — and even violently destroying cans of the beer. One particularly jarring response came in an Instagram video posted Tuesday by the singer-songwriter Kid Rock. “F--- Bud Light and f--- Anheuser-Busch,” he shouted, while wearing a “MAGA” hat, after shooting at cases of Bud Light with what appeared to be a semi-automatic rifle. As of Wednesday afternoon, the video had over 1.2 million views and hundreds of comments, many of them praising the musician’s choice of target. Asked about its partnership with Mulvaney and the subsequent backlash, a spokesperson for the beer conglomerate said, “Anheuser-Busch works with hundreds of influencers across our brands as one of many ways to authentically connect with audiences across various demographics.” Mulvaney did not respond to a request for comment. Mulvaney, who now has more than 10 million followers on TikTok and 1.7 million on Instagram, rose to prominence in March last year, when she started to chronicle her gender transition in her “Days of Girlhood” TikTok series. She was even chosen in October to be among a small group of young advocates invited to meet with President Joe Biden at the White House, where Mulvaney talked to the president about transgender issues. As Mulvaney’s popularity has surged, so has the online criticisms. Shortly after Mulvaney’s sit-down with Biden, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., tweeted out a video of Mulvaney and wrote, “Dylan Mulvaney, Joe Biden, and radical left-wing lunatics want to make this absurdity normal.” Caitlyn Jenner, who, like Mulvaney, is a transgender woman, joined in by sharing Blackburn’s tweet, writing: “@MarshaBlackburn thank you for speaking out and having a backbone — one of the best senators we have. Let’s not ‘normalize’ any of what this person is doing. This is absurdity!” Despite the criticism, Mulvaney continues to share her journey. Last month, she celebrated her first anniversary of transitioning with a cabaret show, “ Dylan Mulvaney’s Day 365 Live! ” at New York City’s iconic Rainbow Room. The live-streamed event raised funds and awareness for The Trevor Project, a suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ young people.

Six ways the fight to ban it could play out The uncertainty around a TikTok ban has left the app’s millions of users and critics with an open question: What’s going to happen to it? A TikTok creator holds a sign supporting the company during a news conference outside the Capitol on March 22. Nathan Howard / Bloomberg via Getty Images Link copied April 8, 2023, 9:40 PM UTC By David Ingram and Daysia Tolentino TikTok is in a kind of limbo. The Biden administration has threatened to ban the popular video app in the United States because of security concerns with its Chinese owners. But there’s no deadline for the White House to make a decision, and Congress might want to have a say in the matter. The uncertainty has left the app’s millions of users and its critics with an open question: What’s going to happen to TikTok? There are a handful of possibilities, and while the timeline is unclear, here’s a guide to six plausible paths forward. Scenario 1: Congress dooms TikTok Then-President Donald Trump tried to ban TikTok in 2020 and failed in large part because courts ruled he didn’t have the legal authority. Now, Congress is thinking of giving that power to President Joe Biden. A bipartisan group of senators introduced a bill last month that would give the U.S. commerce secretary broad power to regulate or ban technology from six countries including China. They’re calling it the Restricting the Emergence of Security Threats That Risk Information and Communications Technology Act, or RESTRICT Act. There are lots of questions about how a TikTok ban might work, but the RESTRICT Act is sweeping in its language , saying the commerce secretary “shall take action” to mitigate certain risks. The bill also doesn’t leave much wiggle room for deliberation, saying the secretary shouldn’t take more than 180 days to determine if something is an “unacceptable risk.” Bipartisan opposition to banning TikTok emerges on Capitol Hill March 30, 2023 03:38 In defending this path forward, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., one of the sponsors, said similar laws are proliferating globally. “Nations across the globe have made steps to mitigate foreign tech. The U.S. isn’t the only country acting on this,” he tweeted Thursday. The bill is a long way from becoming law, but it already has the backing of a quarter of the Senate. In this scenario, if the House and Senate pass it, a ban could become a reality less than a year after Congress acts. Scenario 2: Congress doesn’t act, but Biden bans it anyway Not every senator is rushing to endorse a TikTok ban. Last month, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., blocked an attempt to fast-track the RESTRICT Act, citing free expression. “Have faith that our desire for freedom is strong enough to survive a few dance videos,” Paul said . If Congress doesn’t pass the bill, the Biden administration could still try to restrict or ban TikTok using its current legal authority. A federal government board known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has already privately demanded that TikTok’s Chinese owners sell their stakes in the app, The Wall Street Journal has reported , citing anonymous sources whom it described as people familiar with the matter. NBC News has not confirmed that reporting. The next step, in this scenario, might be an executive order from Biden echoing what Trump issued in 2020. State governors have already been going down that path . But this path involves a lot of legal and political risk for the White House. It would likely need to defend the ban in court — something Trump tried and failed to do in 2020 — and it wouldn’t have the political cover of acting in concert with Congress. Scenario 3: Biden does something small, or nothing at all The idea of a TikTok ban has been floating around since before Biden took office more than two years ago, and he hasn’t done it. So, one scenario is that he never does. The administration and TikTok have been locked in negotiations for years over a potential written agreement that would lay out certain steps for TikTok to follow to help secure the data of Americans and prevent the flow of Chinese propaganda. It could be that those talks result in something that satisfies Biden. Or it could be that other parts of the U.S.-China relationship — the future of Taiwan or the competition for artificial intelligence — take precedence, and the threat of TikTok fades. TikTok has been bolstering its defenses in hopes of reaching a deal. TikTok creators have visited Washington, D.C.; TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew has testified before Congress; and TikTok has pushed an endeavor that it calls Project Texas — working with Austin-based Oracle to store Americans’ data on U.S. soil. Scenario 4: Judges protect TikTok The courts came to TikTok’s rescue in 2020 when the Trump administration tried to restrict the app, as two federal judges in separate lawsuits said the administration had likely overstepped its legal authority and blocked the restrictions. Judge Wendy Beetlestone, an Obama appointee in Philadelphia, sided with TikTok users who were concerned about free expression, while Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee in Washington, D.C., based his ruling on federal regulatory law in a suit that TikTok itself filed. Similar concerns would likely be at issue again if TikTok or its users were to sue, either after a White House move or ahead of time in order to pre-empt it. “Banning TikTok would violate the First Amendment,” Jenna Leventoff, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement last month. “The government can’t impose this type of total ban unless it’s necessary to prevent extremely serious, immediate harm to national security.” TikTok’s success in court isn’t guaranteed, but if it could at least delay any restrictions, that would be some kind of win. And if TikTok or its users wanted to take that path again, they’ll have even more legal muscle the second time around: TikTok has been on a hiring spree for lawyers in the past three years and has plans to hire many more lawyers, Bloomberg Law reported last month, citing eight recent hires and more open positions listed on a TikTok jobs board . Scenario 5: ByteDance sells it A spinoff of TikTok’s U.S. business from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, would in some ways be the easiest path to take. It would avoid the messy political and legal fights over a ban, and users might not notice a difference. And ByteDance is already owned mostly by outsiders. More than 60% of shares are in the hands of “Western investment firms” such as Sequoia Capital, Fidelity and BlackRock, according to congressional testimony last year from Vanessa Pappas, TikTok’s chief operating officer. Founders and employees own “most of the rest,” she said. G42, an investment firm from the United Arab Emirates, bought shares last month , Bloomberg News reported, citing people with knowledge of the deal. China hopes to block this path. Beijing has said it would “ resolutely oppose ” a sale, arguing it would damage investors and hurt confidence for others investing in the United States. China also imposed export restrictions in 2020 that might complicate the transfer of TikTok’s algorithms, although how the rules might apply isn’t clear , according to CNBC. TikTok’s leadership considers a sale a last resort, Bloomberg News reported last month , citing people familiar with the matter. Its U.S. business could pursue either an initial public offering as a standalone company or a sale to a large tech firm such as Microsoft at a valuation of perhaps $40 billion to $50 billion, the news service said. Scenario 6: Congress passes a privacy law for all apps As privacy advocates are always quick to note, the U.S. doesn’t have a national law for privacy on the internet as some other countries do . One scenario is that Congress passes one in the near future, possibly taking some of the heat off TikTok. It’s not entirely far-fetched. Negotiators in the Senate have bargained for years on a possible bipartisan data privacy law, and they seemed to get close to a breakthrough last summer before splintering over how such a law would be enforced. India McKinney, director of federal affairs at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy advocacy group based in San Francisco, said a privacy law wouldn’t have the constitutional issues that a ban might. “If the government is actually concerned with the amount of data that foreign companies like TikTok are collecting on Americans and then using it for whatever, then what they actually really need to do is have a comprehensive data privacy rule because that is what will prevent the collection of the information in the first place,” McKinney said in an interview. It’s not clear whether such a law would satisfy security concerns about TikTok, and it doesn’t preclude simultaneous actions like a TikTok ban, but supporters of the idea say it would put TikTok on similar footing to competitors such as Instagram, YouTube and Snapchat.

Six ways the fight to ban it could play out The uncertainty around a TikTok ban has left the app’s millions of users and critics with an open question: What’s going to happen to it? A TikTok creator holds a sign supporting the company during a news conference outside the Capitol on March 22. Nathan Howard / Bloomberg via Getty Images Link copied April 8, 2023, 9:40 PM UTC By David Ingram and Daysia Tolentino TikTok is in a kind of limbo. The Biden administration has threatened to ban the popular video app in the United States because of security concerns with its Chinese owners. But there’s no deadline for the White House to make a decision, and Congress might want to have a say in the matter. The uncertainty has left the app’s millions of users and its critics with an open question: What’s going to happen to TikTok? There are a handful of possibilities, and while the timeline is unclear, here’s a guide to six plausible paths forward. Scenario 1: Congress dooms TikTok Then-President Donald Trump tried to ban TikTok in 2020 and failed in large part because courts ruled he didn’t have the legal authority. Now, Congress is thinking of giving that power to President Joe Biden. A bipartisan group of senators introduced a bill last month that would give the U.S. commerce secretary broad power to regulate or ban technology from six countries including China. They’re calling it the Restricting the Emergence of Security Threats That Risk Information and Communications Technology Act, or RESTRICT Act. There are lots of questions about how a TikTok ban might work, but the RESTRICT Act is sweeping in its language , saying the commerce secretary “shall take action” to mitigate certain risks. The bill also doesn’t leave much wiggle room for deliberation, saying the secretary shouldn’t take more than 180 days to determine if something is an “unacceptable risk.” Bipartisan opposition to banning TikTok emerges on Capitol Hill March 30, 2023 03:38 In defending this path forward, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., one of the sponsors, said similar laws are proliferating globally. “Nations across the globe have made steps to mitigate foreign tech. The U.S. isn’t the only country acting on this,” he tweeted Thursday. The bill is a long way from becoming law, but it already has the backing of a quarter of the Senate. In this scenario, if the House and Senate pass it, a ban could become a reality less than a year after Congress acts. Scenario 2: Congress doesn’t act, but Biden bans it anyway Not every senator is rushing to endorse a TikTok ban. Last month, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., blocked an attempt to fast-track the RESTRICT Act, citing free expression. “Have faith that our desire for freedom is strong enough to survive a few dance videos,” Paul said . If Congress doesn’t pass the bill, the Biden administration could still try to restrict or ban TikTok using its current legal authority. A federal government board known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has already privately demanded that TikTok’s Chinese owners sell their stakes in the app, The Wall Street Journal has reported , citing anonymous sources whom it described as people familiar with the matter. NBC News has not confirmed that reporting. The next step, in this scenario, might be an executive order from Biden echoing what Trump issued in 2020. State governors have already been going down that path . But this path involves a lot of legal and political risk for the White House. It would likely need to defend the ban in court — something Trump tried and failed to do in 2020 — and it wouldn’t have the political cover of acting in concert with Congress. Scenario 3: Biden does something small, or nothing at all The idea of a TikTok ban has been floating around since before Biden took office more than two years ago, and he hasn’t done it. So, one scenario is that he never does. The administration and TikTok have been locked in negotiations for years over a potential written agreement that would lay out certain steps for TikTok to follow to help secure the data of Americans and prevent the flow of Chinese propaganda. It could be that those talks result in something that satisfies Biden. Or it could be that other parts of the U.S.-China relationship — the future of Taiwan or the competition for artificial intelligence — take precedence, and the threat of TikTok fades. TikTok has been bolstering its defenses in hopes of reaching a deal. TikTok creators have visited Washington, D.C.; TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew has testified before Congress; and TikTok has pushed an endeavor that it calls Project Texas — working with Austin-based Oracle to store Americans’ data on U.S. soil. Scenario 4: Judges protect TikTok The courts came to TikTok’s rescue in 2020 when the Trump administration tried to restrict the app, as two federal judges in separate lawsuits said the administration had likely overstepped its legal authority and blocked the restrictions. Judge Wendy Beetlestone, an Obama appointee in Philadelphia, sided with TikTok users who were concerned about free expression, while Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee in Washington, D.C., based his ruling on federal regulatory law in a suit that TikTok itself filed. Similar concerns would likely be at issue again if TikTok or its users were to sue, either after a White House move or ahead of time in order to pre-empt it. “Banning TikTok would violate the First Amendment,” Jenna Leventoff, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement last month. “The government can’t impose this type of total ban unless it’s necessary to prevent extremely serious, immediate harm to national security.” TikTok’s success in court isn’t guaranteed, but if it could at least delay any restrictions, that would be some kind of win. And if TikTok or its users wanted to take that path again, they’ll have even more legal muscle the second time around: TikTok has been on a hiring spree for lawyers in the past three years and has plans to hire many more lawyers, Bloomberg Law reported last month, citing eight recent hires and more open positions listed on a TikTok jobs board . Scenario 5: ByteDance sells it A spinoff of TikTok’s U.S. business from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, would in some ways be the easiest path to take. It would avoid the messy political and legal fights over a ban, and users might not notice a difference. And ByteDance is already owned mostly by outsiders. More than 60% of shares are in the hands of “Western investment firms” such as Sequoia Capital, Fidelity and BlackRock, according to congressional testimony last year from Vanessa Pappas, TikTok’s chief operating officer. Founders and employees own “most of the rest,” she said. G42, an investment firm from the United Arab Emirates, bought shares last month , Bloomberg News reported, citing people with knowledge of the deal. China hopes to block this path. Beijing has said it would “ resolutely oppose ” a sale, arguing it would damage investors and hurt confidence for others investing in the United States. China also imposed export restrictions in 2020 that might complicate the transfer of TikTok’s algorithms, although how the rules might apply isn’t clear , according to CNBC. TikTok’s leadership considers a sale a last resort, Bloomberg News reported last month , citing people familiar with the matter. Its U.S. business could pursue either an initial public offering as a standalone company or a sale to a large tech firm such as Microsoft at a valuation of perhaps $40 billion to $50 billion, the news service said. Scenario 6: Congress passes a privacy law for all apps As privacy advocates are always quick to note, the U.S. doesn’t have a national law for privacy on the internet as some other countries do . One scenario is that Congress passes one in the near future, possibly taking some of the heat off TikTok. It’s not entirely far-fetched. Negotiators in the Senate have bargained for years on a possible bipartisan data privacy law, and they seemed to get close to a breakthrough last summer before splintering over how such a law would be enforced. India McKinney, director of federal affairs at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy advocacy group based in San Francisco, said a privacy law wouldn’t have the constitutional issues that a ban might. “If the government is actually concerned with the amount of data that foreign companies like TikTok are collecting on Americans and then using it for whatever, then what they actually really need to do is have a comprehensive data privacy rule because that is what will prevent the collection of the information in the first place,” McKinney said in an interview. It’s not clear whether such a law would satisfy security concerns about TikTok, and it doesn’t preclude simultaneous actions like a TikTok ban, but supporters of the idea say it would put TikTok on similar footing to competitors such as Instagram, YouTube and Snapchat.

People work at a construction site in Boston, Mass., on Mar. 17. Michael Dwyer / AP file Link copied April 7, 2023, 9:19 PM UTC By Rob Wile and Brian Cheung Talk of the U.S. entering a recession has been swirling for at least a year now , as the Federal Reserve's campaign to raise interest rates to combat persisting inflation bites into overall demand and investment. To date, a full-fledged economic downturn has not yet materialized. And on Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released jobs data confirming that, at least as of last month, the recession had still not arrived: The U.S. economy added 236,000 jobs in March and the unemployment rate dipped from 3.6% to 3.5%. It was the weakest monthly jobs gain of the post-pandemic period. As a result, there continues to be mixed messages from experts about where the economy is heading. In a Friday note to clients titled \"The Calm Before The Slump,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson signaled that Friday's jobs data may ultimately be a final glimpse into the world before the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank . The tightening of credit and financial conditions that could occur in its wake could tip the economy into a lower, or even declining, mode of growth. “The March data effectively are a look back into the pre-SVB world,” Shepherdson wrote, referring to Silicon Valley Bank and noting that one of the surveys the BLS used to create the latest jobs report was conducted the week before the bank failed. Shepherdson said the uptick in jobless claims seen Thursday , as well as a drop in hiring intentions over the next three months among respondents to a benchmark small businesses survey , signals job gains could begin to turn negative by the summer. \"The hit from tighter credit conditions is coming,\" Shepherdson said. Not everyone agrees. The main takeaway from Friday's jobs report for Michael Antonelli, managing director and market strategist at Baird financial services group, is simple. U.S. economy adds 236,000 jobs in March, showing slowdown April 7, 2023 04:44 Which direction is the economy going? \"Things are fine,\" Antonelli said. At the moment, he said, markets find themselves unsure of where to go next because there is not yet a compelling case to be strongly bullish or strongly bearish. It's a viewpoint confirmed by a March 31 Gallup poll showing that economic confidence has been drifting mostly sideways since the fall. But Antonelli noted the U.S. economy had added approximately 1 million jobs in the first quarter of the year. \"That's not consistent with a recession,\" he said. Antonelli also pointed to another data point showing signs of life: house prices. After a monthslong slump triggered by rising mortgage rates, a report this week from Black Knight, a real estate analytics company, showed home prices increased in February for the first time after seven consecutive month-over-month price declines. \"In many areas of the country ... low inventory and a modest rise in demand ... led to an uptick in home prices,\" Black Knight vice president of enterprise research Andy Walden said in a statement . He said 39 of the 50 largest U.S. real estate markets saw prices increase in February compared to three months earlier, when 48 of those 50 areas were experiencing price declines. \"The purchase market increased when rates declined in the early part of the month and borrowers were quick to take advantage of limited inventory,\" Walden said. Of course, ongoing increases in home prices, driven by continued low inventory, would continue to complicate home-buying affordability. But given the importance of home prices to the financial well-being of households that already own their home, Antonelli said, other aspects of the economy can be expected to hold up. \"If you're comfortable with where the value of your home is going, you're going to continue to go out and buy egg bites at Costco, go on vacation,\" Antonelli said. A significantly deteriorating labor market would begin to put pressure on home prices, he said, adding: \"We just haven't seen either yet.\" The jobs market has held up through a year of rapid interest rate increases from the Fed, which risked throwing employees out of work as higher borrowing costs squeezed businesses. As the unemployment rate continues to hover near historic 50-year lows, inflation has come down — from the 9.1% yearly pace seen last summer to 6.0% as of February . Inflation numbers for March are expected on Wednesday. So if it seems like some economists appear to be in a defensive crouch waiting for the next shoe to drop, it's best to remember that an economy the size of the U.S.'s is a deeply complex machine. And the Federal Reserve has made it clear that it will do whatever is necessary to bring inflation back down to the desired 2% rate. But maneuvering this economy is a delicate undertaking and more interest rate hikes could be on the table, economists at Citi wrote in a Friday note. The latest data, they said, \"points to a labor market that continues to be very tight,\" meaning there are more job openings than available workers to fill them. That could prompt the Fed to continue to be assertive in its effort to keep inflation — which has been on a downward trajectory since June — from creeping back up again.

U.S. economy adds 236,000 jobs in March, showing a slowdown 04:44 Link copied April 7, 2023, 1:07 PM UTC By Jeff Cox, CNBC Nonfarm payrolls rose about in line with expectations in March as the labor market showed increased signs of slowing. The Labor Department reported Friday that payrolls grew by 236,000 for the month, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for 238,000 and below the upwardly revised 326,000 in February. The unemployment rate ticked lower to 3.5%, against expectations that it would hold at 3.6%, with the decrease coming as labor force participation increased to its highest level since before the Covid pandemic. Though it was close to what economists had expected, the total was the lowest monthly gain since December 2020 and comes amid efforts from the Federal Reserve to slow labor demand in order to cool inflation. Along with the payroll gains came a 0.3% increase in average hourly earnings, pushing the 12-month increase to 4.2%, the lowest level since June 2021. The average work week edged lower to 34.4 hours. Leisure and hospitality led sectors with growth of 72,000 jobs, below the 95,000 pace of the past six months. Government (47,000), professional and business services (39,000) and health care (34,000) also posted solid increases. Retail saw a loss of 15,000 positions. The report comes amid a bevy of signs that job creation is on wane. In separate reports this week, companies reported that layoffs surged in March, up nearly 400% from a year ago, while jobless claims were elevated and private payroll growth also appeared to slow. The Labor Department also had reported that job openings fell below 10 million in February for the first time in nearly two years. That all has followed a year-long Fed campaign to loosen up what had been a historically tight labor market. The central bank has boosted its benchmark borrowing rate by 4.75 percentage points, the quickest tightening cycle since the early 1980s and an effort to bring down spiraling inflation. Several Fed officials said this week they remain committed to the inflation fight and see interest rates staying elevated at least in the near term. Markets, though, remain skeptical. Current pricing indicates a slight tilt towards the probability of one last rate hike in May, but with cuts totaling about a full percentage point by the end of 2023. Investors worry that the Fed move are likely to result in at least a shallow recession, something the bond market has been pointing to since mid-2022. In its most recent calculation, through the end of March, the New York Fed said the spread between 3-month and 10-year Treasurys are indicating about a 58% probability of recession in the next 12 months. The Atlanta Fed’s GDP tracker is indicating growth of just 1.5% in the first quarter, after pointing to a gain of as much as 3.5% just two weeks ago.

Honda CRVs on a production line in East Liberty, Ohio, in 2007. Bloomberg / Bloomberg via Getty Images Link copied April 6, 2023, 7:22 PM UTC By Rob Wile Honda is recalling 563,711 older-model CR-Vs in 22 cold-weather states and Washington, D.C., because an accumulation of road salt can cause the vehicle's rear trailing arm to corrode and detach, which could lead to a crash. According to the recall notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's website, Honda said it has received 61 complaints of road salt accumulating and causing frame corrosion. If the vehicle's trailing arm, which is a component of the suspension, detaches as a result of that corrosion, it can cause the driver to lose control of the vehicle, increasing the risk of a crash. The states where the affected model year 2007-2011 CR-V vehicles were sold or registered are: Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Honda estimated 1% of the recalled vehicles may have the defect. As a remedy, Honda said its dealers will inspect and install a support brace or repair the rear frame, as necessary, for free. In some cases, Honda may offer to repurchase the vehicle outright, the company said. Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed May 8. Owners may contact Honda customer service at 1-888-234-2138. Honda’s reference number for this recall is XDZ. Rob Wile Rob Wile is a breaking business news reporter for NBC News Digital.

U.S. economy adds 236,000 jobs in March, showing a slowdown 04:44 Link copied April 7, 2023, 1:07 PM UTC By Jeff Cox, CNBC Nonfarm payrolls rose about in line with expectations in March as the labor market showed increased signs of slowing. The Labor Department reported Friday that payrolls grew by 236,000 for the month, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for 238,000 and below the upwardly revised 326,000 in February. The unemployment rate ticked lower to 3.5%, against expectations that it would hold at 3.6%, with the decrease coming as labor force participation increased to its highest level since before the Covid pandemic. Though it was close to what economists had expected, the total was the lowest monthly gain since December 2020 and comes amid efforts from the Federal Reserve to slow labor demand in order to cool inflation. Along with the payroll gains came a 0.3% increase in average hourly earnings, pushing the 12-month increase to 4.2%, the lowest level since June 2021. The average work week edged lower to 34.4 hours. Leisure and hospitality led sectors with growth of 72,000 jobs, below the 95,000 pace of the past six months. Government (47,000), professional and business services (39,000) and health care (34,000) also posted solid increases. Retail saw a loss of 15,000 positions. The report comes amid a bevy of signs that job creation is on wane. In separate reports this week, companies reported that layoffs surged in March, up nearly 400% from a year ago, while jobless claims were elevated and private payroll growth also appeared to slow. The Labor Department also had reported that job openings fell below 10 million in February for the first time in nearly two years. That all has followed a year-long Fed campaign to loosen up what had been a historically tight labor market. The central bank has boosted its benchmark borrowing rate by 4.75 percentage points, the quickest tightening cycle since the early 1980s and an effort to bring down spiraling inflation. Several Fed officials said this week they remain committed to the inflation fight and see interest rates staying elevated at least in the near term. Markets, though, remain skeptical. Current pricing indicates a slight tilt towards the probability of one last rate hike in May, but with cuts totaling about a full percentage point by the end of 2023. Investors worry that the Fed move are likely to result in at least a shallow recession, something the bond market has been pointing to since mid-2022. In its most recent calculation, through the end of March, the New York Fed said the spread between 3-month and 10-year Treasurys are indicating about a 58% probability of recession in the next 12 months. The Atlanta Fed’s GDP tracker is indicating growth of just 1.5% in the first quarter, after pointing to a gain of as much as 3.5% just two weeks ago.

EzriCare Artificial Tears have been linked to an outbreak of drug-resistant bacteria never seen before in the U.S. EzriCare Link copied April 9, 2023, 10:00 AM UTC By Erika Edwards The deadly bacteria linked to recalled eyedrops causing infection and blindness had never been seen in the U.S. until 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It has since infected dozens and killed three people. Even though the contaminated bottles have been removed from stores and health care facilities, the CDC expects more cases to be identified. What has infectious disease experts most alarmed is how this bug — a well-known type of bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa — has evolved in a way that is resistant to nearly all available treatments. As of April 7, the CDC had identified 68 cases of a new strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 16 states. The investigation is still underway, although the agency has to wait for states to report other cases. More than half of the cases have been found in long-term health care facilities. Nearly all are linked to contaminated eyedrops that had been imported from India. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been around for years. In 2020, there were an estimated 28,800 drug-resistant cases in hospitals in the United States, a CDC investigator not authorized to speak to the media said. But the new infections revealed a form that had never before been reported in the U.S.: carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa with Verona integron-mediated metallo-β-lactamase and Guiana extended-spectrum-β-lactamase. The long name basically shows how its genes have transformed to make it more drug resistant over time. \"This was a Pseudomonas original,\" Dr. Robert Bonomo, a professor of medicine at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland who has studied a variety of drug-resistant bacteria since 1990, said in an interview. Tainted eyedrops linked to three deaths and extensive vision loss March 22, 2023 02:02 The CDC's investigation revealed that the infections linked to the eyedrops may only be treated by one known antibiotic, called cefiderocol. There's nothing new about the way the mutated bacteria harms the body. It's the drug resistance that makes it so dangerous. Eye infections have been most common. But because the eyes are directly linked to the nasal cavity, the bacteria can move into the respiratory tract and lead to pneumonia. \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa can affect pretty much any tissue in the body as travels through the blood, and it can cause sepsis,\" said Dr. Guillermo Amescua, a cornea specialist at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Amescua's team has treated seven patients affected by the outbreak. The Connecticut Department of Public Health investigated its first case in June 2022. Since then, a department spokesman said, the agency has identified 26 patients. Most have been in long-term health care facilities. Otherwise healthy people can spread the bacteria without ever knowing they carry the bacteria on their skin, although there is no evidence of person-to-person spread outside of health care facilities, the CDC expert said. Most cases have been linked directly to the contaminated eyedrops. What eyedrops have been recalled? EzriCare artificial tears was the brand most commonly reported among those who later became ill. Those drops have since been recalled , along with Delsam Pharma's Artificial Tears and its Artificial Eye Ointment . Three patients have died. Eight needed corneal transplants. Four have had at least one eye removed. The CDC first alerted the public to the potential danger surrounding the eyedrops in a statement on Jan. 20. But physicians across the country had been reporting cases of the new bacterial infections since at least last summer. On Monday, the Food and Drug Administration released a preliminary report from an inspection at the Global Pharma Healthcare facility in India, finding problems with the manufacturing process and the factory's measures to assure sterility, according to reporting from The Associated Press. Most of the infections were not caught until they were advanced. Juan Lopez and his wife, Mercedes Lopez. This occurred in the case of Juan Lopez, 93, of Miami, Florida. He'd been using the now recalled EzriCare artificial tears for months before developing an eye infection in January. His doctor prescribed antibiotic eyedrops. But by the beginning of February, Lopez developed a 103 degree fever and was hospitalized. Blood tests revealed drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Lopez was successfully treated, and advises others to pay attention to unusual symptoms. \"Don't delay. Definitely go get checked,\" he said. The mutated strain of Pseudomonas underscores the growing risk of antibiotic resistance . \"These bacteria were on the planet way before we were, and over millions and millions of years, they've evolved mechanisms by which they can survive,\" said Bonomo, the Cleveland professor. \"We like to think we can keep up, but they have the propensity to be one step ahead,\" Bonomo said. \"This puts us in a bad place.\" Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook .

One infant died at 13 months, and the other was in hospice care. Electron microscope image of the virus that causes Covid-19. U.S. National Institutes of Health / AP Link copied April 7, 2023, 4:36 PM UTC / Source : Reuters By Reuters Researchers at the University of Miami reported on Thursday what they believe are the first two confirmed cases in which the SARS-CoV-2 virus crossed a mother’s placenta and caused brain damage in the infants they were carrying. Doctors previously had suspected this was possible, but until now, there was no direct evidence of Covid-19 in a mother’s placenta or an infant’s brain, the team told reporters at a news briefing. The babies were born to young mothers who tested positive for the virus during their second trimester at the height of the pandemic’s Delta wave in 2020, before vaccines were available. The case studies were published in the journal Pediatrics. Several viruses are known to be capable of crossing the placenta and causing fetal brain damage, including Cytomegalovirus, Rubella, HIV and Zika. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been detected in adult brain tissue, and some experts had suspected it could also damage fetal brain tissue. “This is the first time that we’ve been able to demonstrate the virus in a fetal organ with transplacental passage,” Dr. Michael Paidas, chair of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Miami, told the briefing. “That’s why we think this is so important.” The newborns had seizures from the first day of life. However, unlike Zika, the babies were not born with microcephaly, a condition marked by small head size. Instead, microcephaly developed over time as their brains stopped growing at a normal rate, the team said. Both infants had severe developmental delays. One of the children died at 13 months, and the other was in hospice care, the team said. Neither of the infants tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but they did have high levels of Covid antibodies in their blood, Dr. Merline Benny, a neonatologist and assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Miami, told the briefing. She said that suggests the virus crossed from the mother, through the placenta and to the baby. The team found evidence of the virus in both mothers’ placentas. An autopsy of the child’s brain who died revealed Covid virus in the brain, suggesting direct infection caused the injuries, Benny said. As for the mothers, although both tested positive for the virus, one woman had only mild symptoms and carried the baby full term while the other was so sick that doctors had to deliver the baby at 32 weeks of gestation. Dr. Shahnaz Duara, an obstetrician and gynecologist at the University of Miami, said she believed the cases were rare, but urged women who had been infected during their pregnancies to inform their children’s pediatricians to check for developmental delays. “We know that things can be fairly subtle up to seven or eight years of age, until kids go to school,” she said. The team also urged women who were considering pregnancy to get vaccinated against Covid, and said pregnant women should consider vaccination. It was not yet clear whether the injuries caused during pregnancy were unique to the delta variant or could occur with omicron-related variants.

U.S. National Institutes of Health / AP Link copied April 7, 2023, 4:36 PM UTC / Source : Reuters By Reuters Researchers at the University of Miami reported on Thursday what they believe are the first two confirmed cases in which the SARS-CoV-2 virus crossed a mother’s placenta and caused brain damage in the infants they were carrying. Doctors previously had suspected this was possible, but until now, there was no direct evidence of Covid-19 in a mother’s placenta or an infant’s brain, the team told reporters at a news briefing. The babies were born to young mothers who tested positive for the virus during their second trimester at the height of the pandemic’s Delta wave in 2020, before vaccines were available. The case studies were published in the journal Pediatrics. Several viruses are known to be capable of crossing the placenta and causing fetal brain damage, including Cytomegalovirus, Rubella, HIV and Zika. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been detected in adult brain tissue, and some experts had suspected it could also damage fetal brain tissue. “This is the first time that we’ve been able to demonstrate the virus in a fetal organ with transplacental passage,” Dr. Michael Paidas, chair of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Miami, told the briefing. “That’s why we think this is so important.” The newborns had seizures from the first day of life. However, unlike Zika, the babies were not born with microcephaly, a condition marked by small head size. Instead, microcephaly developed over time as their brains stopped growing at a normal rate, the team said. Both infants had severe developmental delays. One of the children died at 13 months, and the other was in hospice care, the team said. Neither of the infants tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but they did have high levels of Covid antibodies in their blood, Dr. Merline Benny, a neonatologist and assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Miami, told the briefing. She said that suggests the virus crossed from the mother, through the placenta and to the baby. The team found evidence of the virus in both mothers’ placentas. An autopsy of the child’s brain who died revealed Covid virus in the brain, suggesting direct infection caused the injuries, Benny said. As for the mothers, although both tested positive for the virus, one woman had only mild symptoms and carried the baby full term while the other was so sick that doctors had to deliver the baby at 32 weeks of gestation. Dr. Shahnaz Duara, an obstetrician and gynecologist at the University of Miami, said she believed the cases were rare, but urged women who had been infected during their pregnancies to inform their children’s pediatricians to check for developmental delays. “We know that things can be fairly subtle up to seven or eight years of age, until kids go to school,” she said. The team also urged women who were considering pregnancy to get vaccinated against Covid, and said pregnant women should consider vaccination. It was not yet clear whether the injuries caused during pregnancy were unique to the delta variant or could occur with omicron-related variants.

For short-term weight loss, drugs like semaglutide aren't the answer. An ad for Wegovy from the online health startup Ro in the Times Square subway station in New York on Wednesday. Elise Wrabetz / NBC News Link copied April 7, 2023, 10:00 AM UTC By Berkeley Lovelace Jr. With powerful weight loss drugs like Wegovy soaring in popularity, you'd be forgiven for thinking they offer a quick fix to lose a few pounds. But is that what these drugs are offering? Wegovy, or semaglutide, is approved for weight loss in adults with obesity, as well as some people who are overweight and have weight-related health conditions. At a lower dose, it’s sold under the brand name Ozempic to help people with diabetes control their blood sugar levels — although it is sometimes prescribed off-label for weight loss. Both come from drugmaker Novo Nordisk. In clinical trials, Wegovy was shown to reduce body weight in people with body mass indexes, or BMIs, of 27 or greater by around 15% over 68 weeks. People on average lost about an eighth of that weight in the first month. But how effective is the drug in people without obesity? And can it help with short-term weight loss? How does Ozempic work, and what are the side effects? March 21, 2023 03:33 Dr. Shauna Levy, a specialist in obesity medicine and the medical director of the Tulane Bariatric Center in New Orleans, said that while it wouldn't be harmful for people without obesity to use the drugs, they'd most likely be sorely disappointed with the results. That’s because, Levy said, the effects take time. Doctors will typically start patients on lower doses of Wegovy — usually 0.25 milligrams — and gradually increase them over several weeks as people adjust to the effects of the medication, which slows how quickly the stomach empties and can cause nausea and stomach pain. “It’s been my experience that it can take three months to really start seeing weight loss,” she said. The effects may also not be the same for someone who isn’t overweight, she said, adding that Wegovy hasn't been studied in patients with BMIs below 27. “In normal-BMI patients, if people are trying to reach a one-month goal and maybe they don’t have obesity and they’re not supervised by a physician, it may not be exactly the same,” she said. “Obesity is a chronic progressive disease,” Levy said. “To me, that’s a different circumstance than just trying to lose weight to go to a pool party or something like that.” Nicole Araujo, a spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, said in a statement that Wegovy is intended for long-term use in people with obesity or people who are overweight and have a weight-related health problem. “Novo Nordisk does not promote or condone the misuse of its medicines in any form,” she said. Latest news on weight loss drugs The high price of Ozempic is pushing many to unregulated, copycat drugs for weight loss Ozempic shortages? Some pharmacists are choosing not to stock the drug at all People with diabetes struggle to find Ozempic as it soars in popularity as a weight loss aid Dr. Holly Lofton, the director of the weight management program at NYU Langone Health in New York City, said that because the medication is meant to be used long-term, people who start the drug — and then stop it after they reach their weight loss goals — may regain the weight . “Your body’s hunger hormones are the highest when you’re at that max weight loss,” she said. “It’s really not intended for short-term weight loss.” People should also know the medication can come with unpleasant side effects, like vomiting. Eating too much or drinking too much alcohol can make it worse. “An analogy I use is opening up your faucet full-stream and as you slowly turn it off to a drip, that is what Wegovy is doing to your stomach,” Lofton said. “So if I just turn on the faucet and shut it off all of sudden, it would make you throw up, because all the water would back up.” Levy said people may also be at risk of losing their skeletal muscle mass, which can “ultimately make themselves less healthy.” Dr. Susan Spratt, an endocrinologist and the senior medical director of the Population Health Management Office at Duke Health in North Carolina, said people with “normal” BMIs — 25 and under — don’t need to use Wegovy. “I think all of us would like to lose five or 10 pounds, but you have to do it in a healthy way,” she said. She recommended that people get at least 150 minutes of exercise every week. People should eat mostly fruits and vegetables, with a little bit of protein, starch and fats, she said. “Weight loss is a long-term change in your habits. That is the best thing you can do,” she said. Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook . Berkeley Lovelace Jr. Berkeley Lovelace Jr. is a health and medical reporter for NBC News.

A premature baby in a neonatal intensive care unit. Matt Nighswander / NBC News Link copied April 6, 2023, 3:58 PM UTC By The Associated Press The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday ordered the immediate market withdrawal of a drug intended to prevent premature births , which has remained available for years despite data showing it doesn’t help pregnant women . The decision follows repeated efforts by Swiss drugmaker Covis Pharma to keep Makena on the U.S. market while it conducted additional studies. The medication was the only drug approved in the U.S. to help reduce the risk of early births in women with a history of preterm deliveries. In recent months, Covis finally bowed to FDA pressure, proposing a “winding down” period of several months so that women taking the drug could complete their treatment. The FDA rejected that and said Thursday that the action against Makena and several generic versions should take effect immediately. “Makena and its generics are no longer approved and cannot lawfully be distributed in interstate commerce,” the agency said in a statement. The decision by FDA Commissioner Robert Califf and the agency’s chief scientist marks the first time the FDA has formally forced the removal of a drug that it initially approved based on promising early data. In all prior cases, drugmakers voluntarily pulled medications after the FDA made clear it intended to order removal. The injectable drug is a synthetic version of the hormone progesterone, which helps the uterus sustain pregnancy. Covis Pharma's injectable Makena medication. Covis Pharma via AP The FDA expedited Makena’s approval in 2011 based on a small study suggesting it reduced rates of premature birth in women who had previously had trouble bringing a pregnancy to term. But results from a 1,700-participant study completed in late 2018 showed the drug neither reduced premature births — as originally thought — nor resulted in healthier outcomes for babies. The FDA has been working to get the drug off the market since then, though Covis repeatedly appealed for more time to conduct further research. In October, the company failed to convince a panel of outside FDA advisers that the drug should stay on the market for certain women. “It is tragic that the scientific research and medical communities have not yet found a treatment shown to be effective in preventing preterm birth and improving neonatal outcomes,” Califf said in a statement Thursday. The FDA has faced pressure to crack down on unproven drugs cleared under its accelerated approval program, which since the early 1990s has allowed dozens of drugs to launch based on early results. The flipside of the program means removing drugs if their initial promise isn’t confirmed by later studies. Researchers and government watchdogs have chronicled problems with FDA’s oversight, including delays in quickly removing drugs with failed or missing confirmatory studies. In the last two years the FDA has stepped up efforts to remove unproven approvals, mainly from cancer therapies. Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook .

Starbucks' new Oleato coffee beverages. Starbucks Link copied April 6, 2023, 3:16 PM UTC / Source : TODAY By Joseph Lamour, TODAY Starbucks customers have taken to social media to share their experiences with the coffee chain’s new slate of olive oil-infused drinks , and apparently, for some, the picture is not so pretty. On March 16, a post titled “ Olive oil drinks... ” was added to the subreddit r/starbucks by a Redditor who claims to be a current Starbucks barista. In it, they share an experience their coworkers allegedly had after trying the new roster of Oleato drinks. For those unfamiliar, these new coffee drinks are infused with Partanna cold-pressed extra-virgin olive oil and debuted on Feb. 21 in limited markets. “Have you tried them? I’m wondering how many people are going to have happen to them what a few happened to our team,” wrote Redditor u/MoodyStarGirl. “Half the team tried it yesterday and a few ended up... Needing to use the restroom, if ya know what I mean.. I’m honestly scared to try it because I already have stomach/bowel problems.” Former Starbucks CEO faces anti-union accusations at Senate hearing March 29, 2023 01:58 The Reddit user, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment, went on to say that their store manager “doesn’t want us sharing this info with customers,” claiming the omission is “pretty F’d up.” Starbucks also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the comments section of the Reddit post, many others chimed in, with some sharing their own impressions and experiences with the drinks, which include lattes, shaken espressos, golden foam cold brews, cortados, a martini and more. “Caffeine is a stimulant for your bowels and oil a relaxant,” wrote one Redditor. “So yeah wonderful idea by Starbucks.” “Person with stomach / bowel problems thanking you for the heads up,” wrote another. “I’ve tried them, and tbh after drinking them honestly they just felt sick to my stomach lowkey,” commented another. “Like i had no appetite at all after that and that was the only thing i’ve had in the whole day.” The Oleato beverages arrived in select American markets in March. Starbucks “The cold brew is fine until you taste the foam because it’s two pumps of olive oil. like- the foam is green,” wrote another Redditor who says they’re a barista. “Worst of all was the latte for me. you’re immediately hit with just olive oil and i wanted to throw up after yeah i do not recommend.” Another user pointed out , though, that “green olive oil is normal and usually an indication of better quality … Green doesn’t mean it’s bad or gross.” Some reviews of the Oleato drinks have been positive, like that of one Twitter user who wrote , “Starbucks, the new Oleato drink is so damn delicious! Love it!!!” and a Redditor who said , “I tried all 3 and loved all of them. Had no problems whatsoever.” But others detail more stomach-churning experiences with the beverages. “The oleato at Starbucks is a legit laxative,” tweeted one person. “That oleato drink from starbs makin my stomach speak,” tweeted another. “#Oleato — so far my stomach is gurgling and my throat is burning,” wrote another Twitter user, sharing an image of their Venti Oleato Iced Shaken Espresso. “Not sure if it’s the olive oil.” Why could this effect be happening? Consuming oil, like castor oil, has been a proven method for relieving constipation since medicine men sold the salve in the late 1800s . But could a little in your morning coffee act like a “laxative,” as some have claimed? “Castor oil has long been a cure for constipation. Oil of any kind can help stool move through the digestive tract, especially if you’ve been constipated for a while,” Frances Largeman-Roth, RDN, tells TODAY.com. “Olive oil can certainly have this effect too, especially if you’re drinking a venti or grande.” Largeman-Roth also says that if you pair the possible laxative effect of oil with the fact that coffee is a stimulant for the digestive system, and the combo may deliver a one-two punch, sending you straight to the bathroom. “The effects may be more pronounced if you drink Oleato on an empty stomach,” she adds.

A premature baby in a neonatal intensive care unit. Matt Nighswander / NBC News Link copied April 6, 2023, 3:58 PM UTC By The Associated Press The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday ordered the immediate market withdrawal of a drug intended to prevent premature births , which has remained available for years despite data showing it doesn’t help pregnant women . The decision follows repeated efforts by Swiss drugmaker Covis Pharma to keep Makena on the U.S. market while it conducted additional studies. The medication was the only drug approved in the U.S. to help reduce the risk of early births in women with a history of preterm deliveries. In recent months, Covis finally bowed to FDA pressure, proposing a “winding down” period of several months so that women taking the drug could complete their treatment. The FDA rejected that and said Thursday that the action against Makena and several generic versions should take effect immediately. “Makena and its generics are no longer approved and cannot lawfully be distributed in interstate commerce,” the agency said in a statement. The decision by FDA Commissioner Robert Califf and the agency’s chief scientist marks the first time the FDA has formally forced the removal of a drug that it initially approved based on promising early data. In all prior cases, drugmakers voluntarily pulled medications after the FDA made clear it intended to order removal. The injectable drug is a synthetic version of the hormone progesterone, which helps the uterus sustain pregnancy. Covis Pharma's injectable Makena medication. Covis Pharma via AP The FDA expedited Makena’s approval in 2011 based on a small study suggesting it reduced rates of premature birth in women who had previously had trouble bringing a pregnancy to term. But results from a 1,700-participant study completed in late 2018 showed the drug neither reduced premature births — as originally thought — nor resulted in healthier outcomes for babies. The FDA has been working to get the drug off the market since then, though Covis repeatedly appealed for more time to conduct further research. In October, the company failed to convince a panel of outside FDA advisers that the drug should stay on the market for certain women. “It is tragic that the scientific research and medical communities have not yet found a treatment shown to be effective in preventing preterm birth and improving neonatal outcomes,” Califf said in a statement Thursday. The FDA has faced pressure to crack down on unproven drugs cleared under its accelerated approval program, which since the early 1990s has allowed dozens of drugs to launch based on early results. The flipside of the program means removing drugs if their initial promise isn’t confirmed by later studies. Researchers and government watchdogs have chronicled problems with FDA’s oversight, including delays in quickly removing drugs with failed or missing confirmatory studies. In the last two years the FDA has stepped up efforts to remove unproven approvals, mainly from cancer therapies. Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook .

Consuming oil, like castor oil, has been a proven method for relieving constipation since medicine men sold the salve in the late 1800s . But could a little in your morning coffee act like a “laxative,” as some have claimed? “Castor oil has long been a cure for constipation. Oil of any kind can help stool move through the digestive tract, especially if you’ve been constipated for a while,” Frances Largeman-Roth, RDN, tells TODAY.com. “Olive oil can certainly have this effect too, especially if you’re drinking a venti or grande.” Largeman-Roth also says that if you pair the possible laxative effect of oil with the fact that coffee is a stimulant for the digestive system, and the combo may deliver a one-two punch, sending you straight to the bathroom. “The effects may be more pronounced if you drink Oleato on an empty stomach,” she adds.

The potential payoff is a big reason why the dream of asteroid mining has persisted for decades. Lauren Schatzman / NBC News Link copied April 9, 2023, 12:00 PM UTC By Denise Chow Matt Gialich knows the cosmic odds are against him, but he doesn’t seem to care. Gialich is the co-founder of a startup called AstroForge, which aims  to mine platinum from asteroids, process the materials in space and then sell the refined commodities back on Earth. It’s a venture that has the potential to be wildly lucrative, but it’s also one that for decades has seen its share of attempts and failures — remaining a tantalizing but elusive prospect for innovators and investors alike. AstroForge wants to change that. The company is slated to launch its first test mission Tuesday to demonstrate key technologies that could finally turn asteroid mining into a reality. Later this year, the startup has a second test flight planned to study a space rock up close that could become a prime target for a real mining mission. For a company founded in 2021, it’s a timeline that is so ambitious as to almost seem reckless. But with launch costs now a fraction of what they were a decade ago and a more robust commercial space economy than ever before, AstroForge and other deep-space mining startups are poised to pick up where others have failed. Gialich knows that if the tests are successful, they will transform not only his company, but also the entire space industry. “If we work out, this is very, very lucrative,” he said. “I don’t hesitate to say it’s probably the most valuable company ever created, if we’re successful.” Still, there’s a lot hinging on that success. AstroForge, which last year raised $13 million in seed funding, is hardly the first private enterprise to seriously pursue mining operations in space. A company called Planetary Resources was formed in 2009 to explore the idea of robotically mining a near-Earth asteroid . A few years later, a competitor called Deep Space Industries was founded. Both firms had high-profile investors attached. Both have since been acquired and pivoted into different space tech sectors. The potential payoff is a big reason why the dream of asteroid mining has persisted for decades. Platinum is valued at more than $32,000 per kilogram (almost $15,000 per pound). Asteroids are also thought to contain other precious and rare earth metals that are essential for producing many consumer electronics. On Earth, these raw materials are largely controlled by China, making access to them politically challenging. Other mined minerals are being depleted, setting up scarcity issues for future generations. “There’s no easy-to-grab platinum on the surface anymore. It’s not like you can go discover some new continent,” Gialich said. “The next frontier really is space.” Artemis II crew details their upcoming historic moon mission April 6, 2023 05:33 He added that mining resources in the cosmos will cut down on the environmental degradation and associated greenhouse gas emissions that come with mining on Earth. Extracting precious metals in space is no easy task. For one, metal-rich asteroids are less abundant than carbon-rich asteroids, said Richard Binzel, an astronomer who retired last year after spending 33 years teaching planetary science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Extracting valuable metals is also extraordinarily difficult and technologically challenging,” he said, adding that deep-space mining seems more like a “resource for the space economy of the 22nd century,” rather than something that can be achieved in this century. To overcome some of those technological hurdles, some companies have focused on mining water from icy deposits on the moon or space rocks first before jumping to precious metals. It’s the kind of strategy being pursued by the United Kingdom-based Asteroid Mining Corp. Like AstroForge, the company aims to mine platinum from asteroids, but its founder and CEO Mitch Hunter-Scullion said he envisions a “Swiss Army knife approach” in which  missions are tailored to extract whatever materials are of interest to customers, whether that is water, precious metals or other raw materials. “We want to be incredibly modular from the offset, to provide a wide opportunity of applications that start to exploit these resources,” he added. Hunter-Scullion said he is in talks with a company to conduct a mission in early 2026 to collect samples from the moon. Beyond that, the company is eyeing a mission to an asteroid by around 2031. Binzel said he has consulted potential investors on the topic of space-based resources before, and has highlighted each time the enormous challenges of such operations. “I tell them they have to have a very long time horizon,” he said. “The technological gap is too wide right now that I personally don’t see it being economically viable in this century. But, I always add that it would be great if I’m wrong.” Gialich and AstroForge co-founder Jose Acain are counting on that. Gialich said that what sets their company apart from others that came and went before it has a lot to do with fortuitous timing. Access to space has opened up in recent years as competition has increased among commercial rocket companies, significantly driving down the costs of launching into orbit . “When Planetary Resources was around, if you wanted to go to the moon, it would have cost you $400 million,” he said. “We can do that for two orders of magnitude less. It’s not even in the same ballpark.” For AstroForge’s test flight next week, the company purchased a “rideshare” that allows their small spacecraft to be one of several payloads aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Programs like that simply didn’t exist even a few years ago, and it’s one key way that AstroForge is able to move quickly and keep costs manageable. The company also tries to leverage existing processes and knowledge. NASA and Japan’s space agency have both carried out sample-return missions to asteroids , and their findings have helped AstroForge engineers craft their missions and refine their models. “What we’re doing is just taking what they did and trying to make it cheaper,” Gialich said. “NASA built a Ferrari and we’re trying to build a Honda Civic.” The goal of AstroForge's first mission is to demonstrate that the company can refine materials successfully in low-Earth orbit. This will involve heating a piece of metal until it turns from a solid state into a gas, then bombarding it with microwaves to ionize the gaseous metal, or positively charge the atoms. Magnets will then be used to separate out valuable metals from other materials that might be present on a space rock. If all goes well, Gialich said, he wants to carry out the first real mining mission before the end of this decade. Eventually, AstroForge is hoping to extract 1,000 kilograms (about 22,000 pounds) of platinum or \"platinum-group metals,\" which include rhodium, palladium and iridium, during each mission. Though the company has not revealed the price tag for such an undertaking, Gialich said he wants to keep the cost to around $10 million per launch. If AstroForge does manage to pull asteroid mining out of the realm of science fiction, the company stands to earn a tidy profit. Gialich is not shy about the impact those margins could have, but he said he’s just as driven by the environmental and societal reasons to pursue off-world mining. “We have a fundamental crisis when it comes to metal procurement and commodity procurement, and this is a perfect solution to that problem,” he said. “We’re mining space to benefit Earth. We are trying to solve a problem that faces the planet.” Denise Chow Denise Chow is a reporter for NBC News Science focused on general science and climate change.

Climate change is leading to more home runs, says new study 04:04 Link copied April 7, 2023, 12:00 PM UTC By David K. Li The explosion of home runs in Major League Baseball can be traced, in small part, to climate change, according to a study published Friday. In a peer-reviewed paper published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society , Dartmouth College researchers said they can connect at least 500 additional home runs from 2010 to 2019 to Earth's human-made warming. The research was based on their simple premise that \"air density is inversely proportional to temperature,\" according to the paper, and that with all \"else being equal, warmer air is less dense and a batted ball will carry farther.\" \"In some ways this wasn't all that surprising,\" said Dartmouth doctoral student Christopher Callahan, who authored the paper with Nathaniel Dominy, a professor of anthropology; Jeremy DeSilva, the chair of the anthropology department; and Justin Mankin, an assistant professor who studies climate variability and the risks posed by global warming. “It was relatively straightforward. In some ways it was confirming that basic physical understanding that we already had.\" From 1998, the first season of the 30-team MLB, through last year —and not including Covid-shortened 2020 — the number of home runs has varied annually from 4,186 in 2014 to 6,776 in 2019 . If current climate trends continue, researchers said, there will be 192 additional long balls per year by 2050 and 467 more per season by 2100, researchers said. Home runs have been surging in MLB for decades with big league analytics operations pushing batters to swing for the fences as the most efficient manner to score, as opposed to more old-fashioned small-ball methods, such as hitting singles or stealing bases. And Callahan was quick to point out that his team's research accounts for only a small part of the homer-happy trend. \"Certainly the analytics revolution has played a major role,\" Callahan said. \"We say that climate change has caused about 500 more home runs over the past 10 years [2010-19] but that's only about 1 percent of home runs. There's 5,000 a year, so we're only saying 50 per year. Those other factors are definitely more responsible as of now than global warming,\" he added. From the start of pro baseball in the late 19th century through 1993 , there was only one season when the average team hit more than 1 home run per game. But starting in 1994, the average has topped 1 in all but four seasons. The top four homer seasons have all been recorded since 2017 — 1.39 in 2019, 1.28 in 2020, 1.26 in 2017 and 1.22 in 2021. Opening Day 2023: Inside the new rules for MLB March 30, 2023 03:40 In baseball lore, the 1927 New York Yankees are often regarded as the game's greatest team, boasting all-time greats Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig . The 110-win \" Murderers Row \" team hit 158 homers in 155 games, an awe-inspiring total for the day but below average by 21st century standards. So far in this very young 2023 season, there have been 1.19 long balls per game. Perhaps not coincidentally, the average high temperature in the U.S. has also been steadily ticking up . Homer hotbeds of the future will be in outdoor stadiums with more day games, as opposed to parks that are domed — and thus temperature-controlled — and host more night games, according to the Dartmouth research. Kyle Tucker of the Houston Astros hits a home run Wednesday against the Detroit Tigers in Houston. Bob Levey / Getty Images The ballparks that will have more climate-affected home runs will be Chicago’s Wrigley Field, Detroit’s Comerica Park, Minnesota’s Target Field and Denver’s Coors Field, researchers said. And on the other end of the spectrum, venues that won’t feel the heat of climate homers will be St. Petersburg’s Tropicana Field, Miami’s LoanDepot Park, Houston’s Minute Maid Park and Phoenix’s Chase Field, which are all indoor facilities. “One thing that I was surprised by was the amount of variations going forward. Places like Wrigley Field will see a lot more home runs in the future, because it’s open air and a lot of games are played in the daytime,” said Callahan, a Chicago native who grew up blocks away from Wrigley. “And so you get a ton of more [climate-affected] home runs there, but you’ll get a lot fewer in places where there are domes and the games are more frequently played in the evening to start with. So you can get a lot of variation in different parks over time, and that’s something that surprised me.” Gerald Meehl, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, said he, too, sees connections the Dartmouth study made between climate and home runs. “It’s an interesting application of climate change attribution and gets at a very baseball concept of shifting the odds towards a better chance of hitting home runs,” Meehl said. Speaking as an avid baseball fan and less as a scientist, Callahan said he’s mostly afraid of global warming’s impact on humankind — but also mildly miffed about its influence on America’s pastime. “I am a little bit disinterested in a game of baseball that’s all about home runs,” Callahan said. “I do like a little more action on the field. If it is the case that global warming will provide an extra incentive to just focus on home runs, I personally would not be super happy about that.” David K. Li David K.

There have been at least 478 tornado reports this year across 25 states as of Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service. Only 2017, with 503 tornado reports, and 2008, with 523, had more at this point in the year. Pinning down how tornado activity will change in a warming world — if at all — is an active area of research, and more data is needed. But a picture is emerging of how risks are changing across parts of the country, particularly in areas where social factors compound vulnerabilities to extreme weather. This year’s active start can be blamed, at least in part, on the mild winter conditions experienced across much of the country , said Harold Brooks, a senior research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Severe Storms Laboratory. Warmer-than-usual winters create the type of atmospheric instability in early spring that is a key ingredient for severe storms, including those that spin up tornadoes. “If you don’t get the cold fronts across the Gulf, all you need is a little bit of wind to bring in a lot of warm, moist air,” Brooks said. “And this has been a year where cold fronts really haven’t gotten that far south. The southern part of the U.S. was not particularly cold this winter.” This dynamic is why tornadoes in the South occur more commonly in the cooler months, from late fall through winter and into early spring. It’s also why this part of the country may become more vulnerable as the world warms. A study published last week in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society found that supercell storms, which can produce violent tornadoes, will increase as the world warms . These storms are also projected to hit Southern states like Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee more frequently in the future, according to the research. That shift could have enormous implications, because the South is more densely populated than other parts of the country where tornadoes often strike, said Walker Ashley, an atmospheric scientist at Northern Illinois University and lead author of the recent study on supercell storms. As such, a tornado that touches down in the South is more likely to hit where people live compared to if that same tornado struck somewhere in the Great Plains. “The underlying social landscape of a place like Mississippi compared to, say, Kansas is the primary driver in the difference in impact,” Ashley said. “There’s a lot of people spread out across the landscape in the South, so the odds of somebody being impacted is far greater in Mississippi or Alabama or Arkansas or Tennessee.” These risks are further heightened by existing socioeconomic issues and the prevalence of mobile homes and manufactured housing across the Southeast. On average, 54% of tornado-related fatalities are in mobile homes, according to the weather service . People who seek shelter in mobile homes are also 15 to 20 times more likely to be killed compared to those who take refuge in permanent homes. A man surveys the debris outside his destroyed home Wednesday in Glenallen, Mo. Michael B. Thomas / Getty Images Those grim statistics came into sharp focus last week after a violent tornado ripped through Rolling Fork, Mississippi, causing widespread destruction in a predominantly Black community where roughly 21% of the residents in poverty. The county’s coroner said eight of the town’s 13 deaths involved people in mobile homes. So far this year, more than 60 deaths have been linked to tornadoes.  The yearly average for tornado-related deaths in the United States is 71. While the season is off to an active start, there's no indication that the pace of severe storms will continue in the months ahead, said Jason Naylor, an associate professor of atmospheric science at the University of Louisville. “In 2011, we had the busiest tornado year in the last 20-plus years, but at this point, we only had around 240,” he said. “It was looking to be anomalously low, but then a few weeks later, at the end of April, we had a super-outbreak that hit the Southeast, and that ended up being the most tornadoes in a 24-hour period.” Still, the flurry of tornado activity in recent weeks highlights the need to raise awareness about the risks. This is particularly important in parts of the country where tornadoes are expected to strike more frequently in the future, according to Ashley. “I don’t think I would say it’s a new normal,” he said, “but the problem is the normal is always changing.” Denise Chow Denise Chow is a reporter for NBC News Science focused on general science and climate change.

CDC warns dangerous fungus infection poses nationwide threat 01:29 Link copied March 20, 2023, 10:07 PM UTC / Updated April 4, 2023, 5:50 PM UTC By Linda Carroll A drug-resistant and potentially deadly fungus has been spreading rapidly through U.S. health care facilities, a new government study finds. The fungus, a type of yeast called Candida auris, or C. auris, can cause severe illness in people with weakened immune systems. The number of people diagnosed with infections — as well as the number of those who were found through screening to be carrying C. auris —  has been rising at an alarming rate since it was first reported in the U.S., researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Monday. The increases, “especially in the most recent years, are really concerning to us,” the study’s lead author, Dr. Meghan Lyman, chief medical officer in the CDC’s Mycotic Diseases Branch , said in an interview. “We’ve seen increases not just in areas of ongoing transmission, but also in new areas.” The CDC's new warning, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, comes as the Mississippi Department of Health is fighting a growing outbreak of the fungus. Since November, at least 12 people have been infected with C. auris with four \"potentially associated deaths,\" the state's epidemiologist Dr. Paul Byers, said in an email. Petri dish of candida auris in a laboratory in Würzburg, Germany, on Jan. 23, 2018. Nicolas Armer / picture alliance via Getty Images file There has been ongoing transmission at two long-term care facilities, although cases have been identified at several other facilities in the state. \"Unfortunately, multi-drug resistant organisms such as C. auris have become more prevalent among our highest risk individuals, such as residents in long-term care facilities,\" Byers said. The fungus can be found on the skin and throughout the body, according to the CDC. It's not a threat to healthy people, but about one-third of people who become sick with C. auris die. In the CDC report, researchers analyzed state and local health department data on people sickened by the fungus from 2016 through Dec. 31, 2021, as well as those who were “colonized,” meaning they were not ill but were carrying it on their bodies with the potential of transmitting it to others who might be more vulnerable to it. The number of infections increased by 59%, to 756, from 2019 to 2020 and then by an additional 95%, to 1,471, in 2021. The researchers also found that the incidence of people not infected with the fungus but colonized by it increased by 21% in 2020, compared to 2019, and by 209% in 2021, with an increase to 4,041 in 2021 compared to 1,310 in 2020. C. auris has now been detected in more than half of U.S. states, the new study found. CDC Most concerning was the increasing numbers of fungus samples resistant to the common treatments for it. Lyman hopes the paper will put C. auris on health care providers’ radar and spur facilities to practice “good infection control.” The new findings are “worrisome,” said Dr. Waleed Javaid, an epidemiologist and an infectious disease expert and director of infection prevention and control at Mount Sinai Downtown in New York. “But we don’t want people who watched 'The Last of Us' to think we’re all going to die,” Javaid said. “This is an infection that occurs in extremely ill individuals who are usually sick with a lot of other issues.” Even if C. auris moves beyond health care facilities and into communities, it’s unlikely to become a problem for healthy people who do not have invasive medical devices, such as catheters, inserted into their blood vessels, Javaid said. The main problem is preventing the fungus from spreading to patients in hospital intensive care units, Javaid said. Unfortunately C. auris can colonize not only people who come in contact with the fungus, but also patient rooms. “By its nature it has an extreme ability to survive on surfaces,” he said. “It can colonize walls, cables, bedding, chairs. We clean everything with bleach and UV light.” While the fungus was first identified in 2009 in Asia, scientists have determined that C. auris first appeared around the world about a decade earlier, after they re-examined older data and discovered instances where C. auris had been mistakenly identified as a different fungus, Dr. Graham Snyder, medical director of infection prevention at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said in an interview. “It’s the pattern we’ve observed with these types of pathogens,” he said. “Often they start out extremely rare, then they emerge in more and more places and become widespread.” It's important to stop the pathogen so it doesn’t spread beyond hospitals and long-term facilities like the drug-resistant bacteria MRSA did, Snyder said. “It’s not unusual to see MRSA in the community now,” Snyder said. “Will that happen with C. auris? I don’t know. That’s partly why the CDC is raising the alarm.” CORRECTION (March 21, 10:45 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misattributed information about Mississippi’s fungal outbreak. The data came from the state epidemiologist, Dr. Paul Byers, not the state Health Department’s spokesperson, Tammy Yates. Linda Carroll Linda Carroll is a regular health contributor to NBC News.

There have been at least 478 tornado reports this year across 25 states as of Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service. Only 2017, with 503 tornado reports, and 2008, with 523, had more at this point in the year. Pinning down how tornado activity will change in a warming world — if at all — is an active area of research, and more data is needed. But a picture is emerging of how risks are changing across parts of the country, particularly in areas where social factors compound vulnerabilities to extreme weather. This year’s active start can be blamed, at least in part, on the mild winter conditions experienced across much of the country , said Harold Brooks, a senior research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Severe Storms Laboratory. Warmer-than-usual winters create the type of atmospheric instability in early spring that is a key ingredient for severe storms, including those that spin up tornadoes. “If you don’t get the cold fronts across the Gulf, all you need is a little bit of wind to bring in a lot of warm, moist air,” Brooks said. “And this has been a year where cold fronts really haven’t gotten that far south. The southern part of the U.S. was not particularly cold this winter.” This dynamic is why tornadoes in the South occur more commonly in the cooler months, from late fall through winter and into early spring. It’s also why this part of the country may become more vulnerable as the world warms. A study published last week in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society found that supercell storms, which can produce violent tornadoes, will increase as the world warms . These storms are also projected to hit Southern states like Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee more frequently in the future, according to the research. That shift could have enormous implications, because the South is more densely populated than other parts of the country where tornadoes often strike, said Walker Ashley, an atmospheric scientist at Northern Illinois University and lead author of the recent study on supercell storms. As such, a tornado that touches down in the South is more likely to hit where people live compared to if that same tornado struck somewhere in the Great Plains. “The underlying social landscape of a place like Mississippi compared to, say, Kansas is the primary driver in the difference in impact,” Ashley said. “There’s a lot of people spread out across the landscape in the South, so the odds of somebody being impacted is far greater in Mississippi or Alabama or Arkansas or Tennessee.” These risks are further heightened by existing socioeconomic issues and the prevalence of mobile homes and manufactured housing across the Southeast. On average, 54% of tornado-related fatalities are in mobile homes, according to the weather service . People who seek shelter in mobile homes are also 15 to 20 times more likely to be killed compared to those who take refuge in permanent homes. A man surveys the debris outside his destroyed home Wednesday in Glenallen, Mo. Michael B. Thomas / Getty Images Those grim statistics came into sharp focus last week after a violent tornado ripped through Rolling Fork, Mississippi, causing widespread destruction in a predominantly Black community where roughly 21% of the residents in poverty. The county’s coroner said eight of the town’s 13 deaths involved people in mobile homes. So far this year, more than 60 deaths have been linked to tornadoes.  The yearly average for tornado-related deaths in the United States is 71. While the season is off to an active start, there's no indication that the pace of severe storms will continue in the months ahead, said Jason Naylor, an associate professor of atmospheric science at the University of Louisville. “In 2011, we had the busiest tornado year in the last 20-plus years, but at this point, we only had around 240,” he said. “It was looking to be anomalously low, but then a few weeks later, at the end of April, we had a super-outbreak that hit the Southeast, and that ended up being the most tornadoes in a 24-hour period.” Still, the flurry of tornado activity in recent weeks highlights the need to raise awareness about the risks. This is particularly important in parts of the country where tornadoes are expected to strike more frequently in the future, according to Ashley. “I don’t think I would say it’s a new normal,” he said, “but the problem is the normal is always changing.” Denise Chow Denise Chow is a reporter for NBC News Science focused on general science and climate change.

The fungus can be found on the skin and throughout the body, according to the CDC. It's not a threat to healthy people, but about one-third of people who become sick with C. auris die. In the CDC report, researchers analyzed state and local health department data on people sickened by the fungus from 2016 through Dec. 31, 2021, as well as those who were “colonized,” meaning they were not ill but were carrying it on their bodies with the potential of transmitting it to others who might be more vulnerable to it. The number of infections increased by 59%, to 756, from 2019 to 2020 and then by an additional 95%, to 1,471, in 2021. The researchers also found that the incidence of people not infected with the fungus but colonized by it increased by 21% in 2020, compared to 2019, and by 209% in 2021, with an increase to 4,041 in 2021 compared to 1,310 in 2020. C. auris has now been detected in more than half of U.S. states, the new study found. CDC Most concerning was the increasing numbers of fungus samples resistant to the common treatments for it. Lyman hopes the paper will put C. auris on health care providers’ radar and spur facilities to practice “good infection control.” The new findings are “worrisome,” said Dr. Waleed Javaid, an epidemiologist and an infectious disease expert and director of infection prevention and control at Mount Sinai Downtown in New York. “But we don’t want people who watched 'The Last of Us' to think we’re all going to die,” Javaid said. “This is an infection that occurs in extremely ill individuals who are usually sick with a lot of other issues.” Even if C. auris moves beyond health care facilities and into communities, it’s unlikely to become a problem for healthy people who do not have invasive medical devices, such as catheters, inserted into their blood vessels, Javaid said. The main problem is preventing the fungus from spreading to patients in hospital intensive care units, Javaid said. Unfortunately C. auris can colonize not only people who come in contact with the fungus, but also patient rooms. “By its nature it has an extreme ability to survive on surfaces,” he said. “It can colonize walls, cables, bedding, chairs. We clean everything with bleach and UV light.” While the fungus was first identified in 2009 in Asia, scientists have determined that C. auris first appeared around the world about a decade earlier, after they re-examined older data and discovered instances where C. auris had been mistakenly identified as a different fungus, Dr. Graham Snyder, medical director of infection prevention at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said in an interview. “It’s the pattern we’ve observed with these types of pathogens,” he said. “Often they start out extremely rare, then they emerge in more and more places and become widespread.” It's important to stop the pathogen so it doesn’t spread beyond hospitals and long-term facilities like the drug-resistant bacteria MRSA did, Snyder said. “It’s not unusual to see MRSA in the community now,” Snyder said. “Will that happen with C. auris? I don’t know. That’s partly why the CDC is raising the alarm.” CORRECTION (March 21, 10:45 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misattributed information about Mississippi’s fungal outbreak.

Marta Lavandier / AP file Link copied April 7, 2023, 10:36 PM UTC By Suzanne Gamboa Backlash from Latino evangelicals and others who minister to immigrants is growing against a bill that would make it a felony to transport people who may be in the country without legal status. The legislation is part of an immigrant crackdown by Gov. Ron DeSantis and Republicans in the state. But the bill's transportation provision has religious leaders and groups worried about how they will carry out their pastoral work and live their beliefs. The bill, SB1718, proposed by Florida state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia of Spring Hill, includes a provision making it a third degree felony for anyone who \"Transports into or within this state an individual whom the person knows, or reasonably should know, has entered the United States in violation of law and has not been inspected by the Federal Government since his or her unlawful entry from another country.\" The bill will “criminalize the church’s work,\"  said Gabriel Salguero, pastor of The Gathering Place, an Assemblies of God congregation in Orlando, and founder of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition. \"We have schools, we have Sunday school, we have church vans that bring them to worship, we have soup kitchens that we sometimes drive people to who are undocumented because they need food. Sometimes we take them to their lawyer,\" Salguero told NBC News. The legislation was voted on in the Florida Senate Rules Committee in mid-March on a 15-5 party line vote. Two Republican Latino senators on the committee, Sen. Ileana Garcia of Miami and Sen. Ana Maria Rodriguez of Doral, supported the bill. A Latino Democrat, Sen. Victor Torres of Kissimmee, voted against it. The measure awaits a full Senate vote and is pending on the House side. Garcia's office said she was not available for comment because she had traveled home from Tallahassee Thursday night, so was not in the office. A staffer referred NBC News to a news release she issued on the bill. Rodriguez's office also deferred to a news release. Garcia and Rodriguez emphasized the problem of human trafficking in their news releases and stated that the bill would help address the problem. Both used the same bulleted list to highlight provisions in the bill. But neither included the transportation provision that has drawn opposition to the measure from the religious groups. Garcia accused the \"extreme left\" and the media of lying about the bill. She stated she is proud of her record on behalf of immigrants and looks forward to more work on \"issues that improve the quality of life for all our residents and protect the most vulnerable.\" \"Human trafficking is a serious problem that has been made worse by current federal policies that have encouraged caravans of migrants to make the dangerous trek to our borders, completely reliant on taxpayer funded social services,\" Rodriguez stated. Many social services are not available to people without legal status, though children can attend public schools and some clinics provide health care without regard to citizenship or legal status. Matthew Soerens, vice president of policy and advocacy at World Relief, a Christian humanitarian organization, said pastors know their congregants well enough to know who may have crossed borders unlawfully. If a church worker gives the person a ride, it could mean up to five years in prison and up to 15 years if the church staff member picks up a minor for a youth group gathering. Soerens said even if bill sponsors and backers assure churches and religious groups the measure wouldn’t be used against them, most would likely be advised by their lawyers that they have legal liability, so churches and religious groups would not want to put themselves at risk. Soerens noted that the bill specifies transporting migrants who have entered the country unlawfully without inspection, \"so apparently they're not concerned about those who overstayed visas.\" An estimated 42% or more of people in the country illegally entered with a legal visa and stayed beyond its expiration date. Many people who have been now allowed into the country under Biden's immigration policies are asylum seekers who have been \"inspected\" at a border port of entry. Salguero said his church doesn't ask people if they are undocumented, but they do learn of people's status as do many other churches. \"There are over 3,000 Latino evangelical churches in Florida, that's not counting Latino Catholic churches and other Latino mainline (churches),\" he said. Add in Haitian immigrants and churches that serve them, and it's clear that the state is heavily populated by immigrants, he said. José Vega, a minister at Chets Creek Church in Jacksonville, said in an Evangelical Immigration Roundtable press call on March 30 that he wanted to express his \"concern\" about the bill. \"For many years, I have had the liberty to show my unconditional love to people from over the world, serving them in different capacities and transporting them to multiple places,\" he said. The proposal is something of a déjà vu, reminding many working on the legislation of a 2005 federal bill that became known by its sponsor’s name, former GOP Rep. James Sensenbrenner. It also proposed making it a felony to assist immigrants. The legislation, which got U.S. House approval, triggered massive protests by many Latinos and others around the country on May Day 2006 and was opposed by religious groups and churches. But the political landscape has changed since then. The GOP has shifted further to the right. With DeSantis increasingly looking like he will seek the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, he's been pushing a very conservative agenda, including on immigration. Last September, DeSantis sent two planes to Texas to pick up migrants there and deliver them to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts. Groups, such as the Salvation Army and Martha's Vineyard Island Clergy Association, were among those who helped the migrants, many who were asylum seekers and had been released to wait in the U.S. for their pleas to work their way through the immigration system. The recent legislation and the support of some Latino Republicans earned them criticism and accusations of rejecting their heritage from Miami Herald columnist Fabiola Santiago, a Cuban refugee who came to the U.S. as a child aboard the Freedom Flights. She called the bill and its House companion a “slap in the face to our immigrant families — and native-born Americans, who have welcomed immigrants into their lives. ...” “I remember when the first Hispanic caucus went to Tallahassee for one purpose: to represent us,” Santiago wrote. “Now the heirs jauntily walk in the shoes of an immigrant hater and do his bidding without regard to the impact on our communities?” Suzanne Gamboa Suzanne Gamboa is a national reporter for NBC Latino and NBCNews.com Carmen Sesin contributed .

Link copied April 7, 2023, 5:52 PM UTC By Edwin Flores Members of a Latino family are worried after a hammer-wielding woman who threatened them and shouted racist remarks outside their home in St. Louis — all caught on video last year — has been released from jail and placed under house arrest. “We’re stressed,” Fatima Suarez, 22, said in a TikTok post following the news of her family's harasser, Judy Ann Kline, getting released on bond Tuesday. “I don’t agree that they allowed her to be on house arrest because she clearly, she showed and she even said that she’s going to come back.” Kline, 54, was placed under house arrest with a GPS monitoring device with exceptions for medical, religious and court purposes. The judge also ordered her to have no contact with the victims, according to court records. The St. Louis Circuit Attorney’s Office charged Kline with three  felonies in February , including first-degree burglary, first-degree property damage and unlawful use of a weapon in connection with a break-in at the family's home Jan. 5 last year. Suarez said her father and younger sister, then 4, were home when Kline entered the basement by breaking a glass door. Her younger sister heard a noise coming from the basement and when her father went to investigate, he found Kline walking up the steps wielding a hammer. Suarez said her father closed the door and fled the house with his daughter. Kline can be heard shouting, “Get out, you’re a bunch of illegals — you don’t belong on American property,” into the front door Ring security camera, claiming that the home was hers and demanding to see paperwork because, she said, “I know you didn’t buy this house — you don’t have enough money.” Fatima Suarez. KSDK Suarez, who is of Mexican heritage, said that Kline had been harassing the family for more than a year and that the incidents were racially motivated. She uploaded multiple videos online of Kline returning to harass the family five more times, including allegedly attempting to pick the front door lock in February and allegedly stealing mail in March last year. Judy Ann Kline waves a hammer outside the door of the Suarez home. @fatimasrz via TikTok Public records obtained by NBC News showed that Kline was affiliated with the family’s home in the 1990s. Suarez told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that the family moved into the home six years ago. “We had never seen her in our lives,” Suarez said. “She doesn’t live around the neighborhood.” Court records indicate Kline was deemed “incapacitated/disabled” and placed under guardianship and conservatorship from 2006 to 2017. “You don’t deserve to be out AT ALL. YOU HAD THE CHANCE TO HURT MY DAD AND BABY SISTER,” Suarez wrote in a now-deleted Facebook post, a screenshot of which she later uploaded to TikTok. “I’m tired of how the justice system is.” Edwin Flores Edwin Flores reports and produces for NBC Latino and is based in Anaheim, California.
